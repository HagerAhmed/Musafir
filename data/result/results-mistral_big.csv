There is no ball - the con artist will have spirited it away! This con always has people acting as lookouts in the crowd and they will pretend to win every now and again so it looks like the game is winnable. Also beware if you are just stopping to watch as you could be pick-pocketed! The best defence is to walk straight past these events and not engage at all. If you have a mobile phone/cellphone that works in the UK you can phone the police on 101 (the non-emergency equivalent to 999) and report them, but it is advised to move away to do this as you may be harassed by the con artist or their lookouts if they overhear you.",a12fca0f,What should you do if you see a cup and ball scam?,London,a12fca0f

"The variety of products in airport tax-free shops compared to London is somewhat different. In airport tax-free shops, you can find a wide range of duty-free items such as liquor, tobacco, cosmetics, and luxury goods. The selection is often tailored to international travelers, and prices can be lower due to the lack of taxes.

In London, on the other hand, you can find a diverse range of products in various districts, each with its own unique offerings. For example, Covent Garden is known for its shopping and entertainment, Camden has eclectic markets, South Bank has a mix of cultural attractions, and South Kensington-Chelsea is an upscale district with famous department stores. You can also find local specialties like fish and chips, as well as a variety of international cuisines.

However, the specific products you find will depend on where you go in London.

If you're looking for a specific type of product, like alternative fashion, you might want to visit a district known for its unique markets, like Camden.

2. Be aware of scams and avoid engaging with people who approach you asking where you are from or offering ""lucky heather."" If you are handed one of these flowers, hand it back or drop it on the ground and leave.

3. If you have younger children, consider taking a break from sightseeing and spending some time at a park or playground. Villa Borghese is a popular park in Rome with plenty of space for kids to run around and play.

4. Take a walk along the Tiber Island, which has a few playgrounds and a carousel. There are also several cafes and restaurants in the area where you can stop for a snack or a meal.

5. Visit the Testaccio neighborhood, which has a large outdoor market and several family-friendly restaurants.

6. Consider taking a cooking class or a pizza-making workshop, which can be a fun and educational experience for kids and adults alike.

It is important to note that in Rome, the city council levies an accommodation tax, which is €2 per night per person for campsites up to three-star hotels and €6 a night for four- and five-star hotels. This fee can only be paid in cash.

When looking for accommodations, one should also be cautious of false reviews on sites like Tripadvisor and Hotels.com, as some unscrupulous hotel owners are known to create them.

"The context does not provide information regarding the price difference between a bottle of wine and a glass of house wine in Rome. However, it is worth noting that in Cairo, some restaurants in cheaper price ranges might not serve alcohol. This information might indirectly suggest that ordering a glass of house wine in Rome could be more common or appropriate than ordering a bottle, especially in budget-friendly establishments. But to give a definitive answer, I would need data specifically related to wine prices and customs in Rome.","House wines are almost always drinkable and inexpensive. You are better off ordering a bottle rather than house wine in most establishments in Rome due to some places watering down their wines. You may often find a bottle of wine on the table for you.

Additionally, visiting the Galleria d'Arte Antica in the Modern centre for Italian Renaissance and Baroque art is also recommended.

For a more comprehensive experience, families can also check out the National Museum at the Baths of Diocletian in the Modern Centre, the national museum at Palazzo Altemps, and the Museo di Civilta Romana in EUR, which all have extensive archaeological collections. Furthermore, taking a look inside a few churches to see the richness and range of decor from fine classical art to tacky electric candles is also suggested.

"These groups, often consisting of young girls and sometimes men, use various tactics to distract their targets, particularly tourists, in order to pickpocket or scam them. Here are some of the tactics they use:

1. Creating diversions in crowded areas: They often work in groups, with some creating a commotion or distraction, while others pickpocket unsuspecting victims, especially in popular tourist spots like Termini, Esquilino, bus line 64, and the Trevi fountain.

2. Posing as helpful individuals: They may offer assistance when doors are closing on the metro or train, only to take advantage of the situation and pickpocket or scam their targets.

3. Engaging tourists in conversation: Some may approach tourists, asking where they are from, and begin to tie bracelets around their wrists, only to demand payment afterwards.

4. Taking advantage of looking like a tourist: Exhibiting cameras or other valuable items can make tourists easy targets. Keeping a low profile and securing valuables is essential to avoid such distractions.

5. Exploiting kindness and politeness: Tourists may feel obligated to respond to questions or engage in conversation, which can lead to being scammed or pickpocketed. It's important to be cautious and alert when interacting with strangers.

In general, it is advised to be aware of these tactics and remain vigilant when traveling in Rome and other major tourist destinations. Keeping valuables secure, avoiding overly crowded areas, and being cautious when interacting with strangers can help minimize the risk of becoming a victim of these scams and thefts.","Since Rome is incredibly popular as a tourist destination, a great deal of pickpocketing and bag or purse snatching takes place, especially in crowded locations, and pickpocketers in Rome can get pretty crafty.

Please note that hotel rooms are not always safe for valuables, so it's best to check with the hotel staff about safekeeping options.","The area to the southwest of Termini railway station has numerous large hotels; these are used in particular by groups and coach parties. On the other side of the station are many smaller, fairly inexpensive, hotels that are popular with individual travellers. Perhaps the best choice for a first-time visitor is to stay right downtown, (such as near the Pantheon ). Most attractions are walking distance from there, and you will save much transportation time and leave more for enjoying the city.
