Seoul,description,,"Seoul (서울) is the capital of South Korea . With a population of over 9 million (with over 20 million in the wider metropolitan area), Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural centers. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a dynamic trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts, contradictions, and paradoxes. People in Seoul can enjoy various artistic activities such as plays, musicals, and concerts."
Seoul,Districts,,"Administratively, Seoul is divided into 25 districts (구 gu ), each with an area and population comparable to a small city. The districts are then further subdivided into 522 sub-districts (동 dong ). The Han river splits the city into two halves: Gangbuk (강북), the northern, more historical half, and Gangnam (강남), the southern, wealthier and more modern half. The sheer size of the city means that travelers to Seoul will find it difficult to locate a true ""center"" of Seoul; instead, Seoul is almost more like a collection of cities that happen to be bunched together, each with their own central business and commercial districts. The two largest core areas are Jongno/Jung in the north, and Gangnam in the south. For travelers with more time, there are many more, smaller centers and districts to be explored, such as the island of Yeoui-do and the college district of Hongdae/Sinchon. For the typical traveler, it would be useful to divide the city into the following areas:"
Seoul,Districts,,"Jongno (종로) ( Jongno-gu ) The Joseon-era historical core of the city with the famous Joseon Palace, Gyeongbokgung. Bukchon has beautiful traditional Korean house and Insa-dong has the largest antiques market street in Seoul. Cheongyecheon has a renovated stream and park that runs through the heart of the downtown area."
Seoul,Districts,,"Jung (중) ( Jung-gu ) This district makes up the other half of the historic core as well as the shopping districts of Myeongdong and Namdaemun Market. This area contains Seoul Station and Namsan Mountain, with the Seoul Tower at its summit."
Seoul,Districts,,"Seodaemun & Mapo (서대문/마포) ( Seodaemun-gu, Mapo-gu ) These two districts lie immediately west of Jongro and Jung, and contain dozens of universities and colleges. As such, this area is home to some of Seoul's most active nightlife districts: Hongdae (홍대) and Sinchon (신촌)."
Seoul,Districts,,"Yongsan (용산) ( Yongsan-gu ) Yongsan is home to the US Army Military Base as well as one of the huge Yongsan Electronics Market. This is also where you'll find Itaewon (이태원), perhaps the most culturally diverse area in Korea and home to dozens of restaurants featuring cuisine from the world over, numerous shops selling everything from custom-tailored suits to antiques, and several Western pubs and bars."
Seoul,Districts,,"Yeongdeungpo & Guro (영등포 / 구로) ( Yeongdeungpo-gu, Guro-gu ) Covering Yeoui-do on the Han River as well as an area on the south side, this is often referred to as the 'Manhattan of Seoul'. Guro is one of the IT venture company clusters."
Seoul,Districts,,"Gangnam & Seocho (강남 / 서초) ( Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu ) Famed for 'Gangnam Style', this affluent area is the glitzy center of modern Seoul, home to hundreds of glass and steel skyscrapers, neon billboards, and some of the most expensive real estate in the country."
Seoul,Districts,,"Songpa & Gangdong (송파 / 강동) ( Songpa-gu, Gangdong-gu ) A residential district east of Gangnam where you'll find Lotte World, Olympic Park, Seoul (Jamsil) Sports Complex, and the Sincheon nightlife district."
Seoul,Districts,,"North ( Nowon-gu, Seongbuk-gu, Gangbuk-gu, Dobong-gu, Eunpyeong-gu ) Northern area including Eunpyeong, Seongbuk, Gangbuk, Dobong and Nowon. Mt. Bukhansan and Mt. Dobongsan area."
Seoul,Districts,,"South ( Dongjak-gu, Gwanak-gu, Geumcheon-gu ) Area south of the Han river including Dongjak, Gwanak and Geumcheon. This is where you can enjoy fresh seafood at the huge Noryangjin fish market."
Seoul,Districts,,"East ( Jungnang-gu, Gwangjin-gu, Seongdong-gu, Dongdaemun-gu ) Dongdaemun, Jungnang, Gwangjin, Seongdong with greenery and some interesting cultural sites."
Seoul,Districts,,"West ( Gangseo-gu, Yangcheon-gu ) Western area south of the Han river and including Gangseo and Yangcheon"
Seoul,See,,"Seoul is a vast, vibrant cityscape, set against an airy backdrop of mountains. It includes a standout collection of attractions with a blend of old and new."
Seoul,See,,"While Seoul today is mostly known as a super-modern mega-city that is home to skyscrapers, malls, and millions of electronic-mad Koreans, the city contains over 2,000 years of history. The city contains 4 UNESCO sites marking important monuments from its 505 years as the capital of the Joseon Dynasty. Originally a walled city with 20 ft (6.1 m) stone walls and narrow lanes inside. Though many buildings were destroyed or damaged during the violent events of the first half of the 20th century, much of its historic core remains. So, anyone staying in Seoul should visit the many historical treasures the city has to offer, including the many palaces and city gates within the Jongno district."
Seoul,See,,"Seoul has been a capital of Korea since the Joseon Dynasty. Starting from the Gyeongbokgung, many palaces were built for kings and royal family. The most important of them are called Five Grand Palaces (5대궁). Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest and most important palace, and is also the site of the Joseon Palace Museum and Korean Folk Museum . The main gate of the palace, Gwanghwamun , and its plaza are the center of Seoul. Changdeokgung , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , was the most favored residential palace of the Joseon Royal Family. It also has the beautiful garden named Secret Garden (Also was called 'Forbidden Garden'). Changgyeonggung and Gyeonghuigung are less famous due to extensive damage sustained after the fall of the Joseon Dynasty; Changgyeonggung was once a zoo, and Gyeonghuigung was once a high school. Finally, Deoksugung was used during the last years of the monarchy. It has a harmony of both traditional and western building design. All of these palaces have a thicker, more informative pamphlet for ₩500, which is worth the cost."
Seoul,See,,"There are several traditional spots in Seoul besides palaces. Jongmyo Shrine is where the kings of the Joseon Dynasty are enshrined, and the Jongmyo Jerye ceremony, in which descendants of the Joseon royal family honor their ancestors, is held here every year.

Olympic Park was built on ancient fortification walls, and holds many venues used in the 1988 Olympics. Worldcup Park was a landfill, but was turned into a large park with a soccer stadium, and is famous for silver grass. Seonyudo Park was a water filtration plant and was changed to ecological park above the remnants of old tanks and reservoirs. Other famous parks include Children's Grand Park and Dream Forest .

Seoul,See,,"Gyeongbokgung Palace. In 1-91, Sejongno, Jongno-gu. The Gyeongbokgung, which means ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven."", was built in 1395 in Joseon Dynasty. It was the heart of Joseon Dynasty because the government ministry district was focused here. Even after it was razed by the Japanese during Hideyoshi invasions of 1592–1598, it was reconstructed in 1876, only for many buildings to be razed again by the Japanese during the occupation from 1910–1945. Nevertheless, Gyeongbokgung remains one of the most magnificent and historically most significant places in Seoul, and restoration to its pre-Japanese occupation state continues to be take place at a painstaking pace. It opens everyday except Tuesday. There is also a free guide tour for tourists every day (English : 11:00, 13:30, 15:30).

Seoul,Eat,,"Much of Korean social life revolves around food and the city is packed with restaurants, so you would have to be determined to starve to death in Seoul. This fate may still befall you if you insist on English menus and meals consisting only of easily identifiable, familiar ingredients, so see South Korea#Eat for a quick Korean menu reader. An alternative is to just point and eat, your hosts generally will accommodate. If you look in the right places, a good meal (lunch or dinner) including side dishes can cost ₩5,000 or less (try basements of large department stores)."
Seoul,Eat,,"In addition to Korean food, Japanese restaurants in Seoul tend to be excellent, featuring excellent sushi and sashimi. Chinese restaurants exist, but are typically adapted to suit local preferences. There are a few Italian restaurants; these are generally excellent, with chefs trained in Italy, although flavors tend to be more or less Koreanized, with sugar in the garlic bread and meatballs."
Seoul,Eat,,"Bakeries are found throughout, including some of the common big chains."
Seoul,Eat,,"Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including: mandu, odeng, ddeokbokki, naengmyeon, udong and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about ₩2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul.  These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality.  Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere)."
Seoul,Eat,,"Don't be surprised if you find yourself with 5 plates even though you only ordered one, most main dishes are served banchan , side dishes such as kimchi , fermented vegetables with spices, and soup to rinse your palate before and/or after eating. While this is great, this could also be the reason why some restaurants doesn't accept solo dining, especially in Korean BBQ, since the portions might be too much for a single person; always make sure to ask if it's ok to eat alone by telling them “han myung” – a table for one person."
Seoul,Eat,,"Public trash bins around Seoul are rare. If you're eating street food, you can hand back leftover trash, like skewers, to the food vendors or throw it away in their trash bags. Some leave a box for trash in front of their stand. Other places to find trash bins are restrooms and convenience stores."

Itaewon in Yongsan is Seoul's international district, with a wide variety of Western-styled venues to eat and drink. Since many foreigners congregate there, Itaewon remains somewhat of a niche nightlife area for Koreans interested in a more international scene. Itaewon is also home to the highest concentration of gay bars in Seoul, in an alleyway known as ""Homo Hill"". Much nightlife in Seoul revolves around soju. Soju is a traditional Korean spirit that comes in many varieties, including original and many kinds of fruit-flavored soju."
Seoul,Sleep,,"Seoul has two unofficial backpacker districts, Jongno (Anguk/Sinseol-dong) to the northeast of the city and Hongdae-Sinchon out to the west.

Seoul,Stay safe,,"Seoul is a remarkably safe city despite its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo . Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is very rare. There are very few places where CCTV cameras are absent."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"If you happen to be a non-Korean man walking hand-in-hand with a Korean woman, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. This is far less of a problem than it used to be."

Seoul,Stay safe,,"Unfortunately, crimes by American soldiers against Koreans do happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a Westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Protesting : Large-scale demonstrations against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in violence where there are pitched battles between protesters and combat police. People do get seriously hurt, so try to avoid getting too close to the action."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Fake monks have been known to operate in Seoul, notably around the Jogyesa temple. They are dressed as Buddhist monks requesting donations from people on the street in return for blessings, although they do not actually belong to any Buddhist order and just keep the cash for themselves. Actual monks would never seek donations in this manner. If you want to donate money, put it into the donation box in temples."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Scams: Be wary of Korean people randomly coming to teach you about Korean culture and inviting you to try a Korean tradition in their studio. They tend to be very friendly to foreigners, offer to try a traditional Korean outfit and see a real-life Korean ceremony and then ask for money during or after it is done."
