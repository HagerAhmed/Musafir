Cairo,description,,"Cairo (pronounced KY-roh ; Arabic : القاهرة al-Qāhirah ) is the capital of Egypt (until the New Administrative Capital is completed) and, with a total population of Greater Cairo metropolitan area in excess of 16 million people, one of the largest cities in both Africa and the Middle East (the regions which it conveniently straddles). It is also the 19th largest city in the world, and among the world's most densely populated cities."
Cairo,description,,"On the Nile river, Cairo is famous for its own history, preserved in the fabulous medieval Islamic city and Coptic sites in Old Cairo — with historic Cairo inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list . The Egyptian Museum in the city centre is a must see, with its countless Ancient Egyptian artefacts, as is shopping at the Khan al-Khalili bazaar. No trip to Cairo would be complete without a visit to the Giza Pyramids and to the nearby Saqqara Pyramid Complex , where visitors will see Egypt's first step pyramid built by the architect Imhotep for the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser."
Cairo,description,,"Though firmly attached to the past, Cairo is also home to a vibrant modern society. The Midan Tahrir area situated in downtown Cairo, built in the 19th century under the rule of Khedive Ismail, has strived to be a ""Paris on the Nile"". There also are a number of more modern suburbs including Ma'adi and Heliopolis , while Zamalek is a quiet area on Gezira Island , with upmarket shopping. Cairo is best in the autumn or spring, when the weather isn't so hot. A felucca ride on the Nile is a good way to escape from the busy city, as is a visit to Al-Azhar Park."
Cairo,Districts,,"Greater Cairo is vast; with more than 20 million people (2018), it's the largest metropolitan area in Africa and the Middle East."
Cairo,Districts,,"Downtown The modern city centre. Midan Tahrir (meaning ""Liberation Square"") was the scene of the massive 2011 protests that ousted President Mubarak, and big (sometimes violent) rallies and protests still occur here. Just north of the square is the Egyptian Museum, and many big hotels are nearby. The Downtown area stretches east 2 km to Midan Ramses, which contains Cairo's main railway station and a burgeoning retail and accommodation zone."
Cairo,Districts,,"Garden City A district close to the city centre and the Corniche el-Nil, a good option for central accommodation."
Cairo,Districts,,"Old Cairo Located south of downtown, includes Coptic Cairo, Fustat (Cairo's historical kernel) and Rhoda Island."
Cairo,Districts,,"Islamic Cairo Located east of downtown, this was the centre of historic Cairo beginning in the 10th century. Contains the Citadel, Mohamed Ali Mosque, Khan el Khalili (the main bazaar or souq ), historic mosques and medieval architecture, as well as some of Cairo's Turkish baths (hammams)."
Cairo,Districts,,"Dokki and Mohandeseen (Giza) Located on the west bank of the Nile, with upscale restaurants, shopping, and accommodation."
Cairo,Districts,,"Gezira Island Upmarket district on a large island in the Nile. The Cairo Tower, the Opera House, Zamalek neighborhood, and some nice shopping, restaurants, cafés, and accommodation are located here."
Cairo,Districts,,"Giza Everything west of the Nile's west bank is actually in Giza city rather than Cairo city. So it's a sprawling conurbation in its own right, including the Nile islands of Gezira and Roda, and the riverside districts of Dokki and Mohandeseen. But above all it's renowned for the pyramids , at Giza's western edge: this area is known as the Haram (pyramid) district. The Grand Egyptian Museum opens here in 2023."
Cairo,Districts,,"Ma'adi A quiet upmarket residential district south of the centre, catering to many foreign expatriates."
Cairo,Districts,,"Eastern districts A series of planned communities which have been built away from the congestion of historic Cairo. From oldest to newest, they include Heliopolis, Nasr City, and New Cairo. These areas are mostly upper-class and commercial centres. Cairo's airport is also here."
Cairo,Districts,,"Northern districts A vast area of mostly low-income, unplanned neighbourhoods."

Cairo,Buy,,"ATMs are found in various places throughout downtown . A more secure option are the ATMs in the five star hotels. There also are numerous places that handle currency exchange, or you can try any major bank such as HSBC or Commercial International Bank for currency exchanges or redeeming travellers cheques. There also are a number of Citibank [dead link] branches in Cairo."
Cairo,Buy,,"Foreign currencies can also be exchanged for Egyptian pound in all the Egyptian banks like Banque Misr , National Bank of Egypt [dead link] , Banque de Caire [dead link] , Arab African Bank [dead link] , the United Bank [dead link] , or the large branches of Bureau de Change."
Cairo,Buy,,"Many merchants will try to scam you out of as much as they possibly can. A particularly common trick are the papyrus museums. They come in many different flavours, but they often call themselves galleries, museums or workshops. You will be given a brief talk or demonstration on how papyrus is made, and warned against cheaper shops that make their papyrus from banana leaf (though no matter where you go, no one has a sample to show you, questioning the legitimacy of this ""warning""). The prices will be in the hundreds, and you will be offered what appears to be an excellent discount. If you look around, however, you will see most of what they offer is worth LE1-5 at the most. Tour guides, taxi drivers and hotel staff are all in on this, and will often get a 50% commission if they lead an unwitting tourist into this trap."
Cairo,Buy,,"The Khan El-Khalili bazaar is a giant souq in Islamic Cairo . The merchants here are ravenous and skilled, so don't fall for the hard sell and be prepared to haggle . This is a great place to buy rustic glassware and perfume bottles. Be choosy."
Cairo,Buy,,"Zamalek has a number of small, but high-end shops, along with shops selling crafts, jewelry and other items. Fair Trade Cairo in Zamalek is a great shop selling high quality crafts made by local artisans. Nefertari, also in Zamalek, has wonderful organic cotton linens, skin care products, and the like. There is also Nomad, that has a small, charming second floor showroom in Zamalek, as well as Nagada, and Khan Misr Taloun. Diwan, in Zamalek, is a very nice primarily English-language bookstore."
Cairo,Buy,,"Midan Talaat Harb and surrounding streets, including Talaat Harb Street, are home to countless shops, selling everything from shoes and books to sweets."
Cairo,Buy,,"The Midan Ataba area in Downtown Cairo is home to large bookseller markets, where you can find inexpensive books, as well as electronics and clothing markets, but be aware of the over crowding, as it is easier to pickpocket."
Cairo,Eat,,"Cairo has an enormous number of restaurants, catering to most needs. Ironically though, one may want to avoid any restaurants listed in popular guidebooks. Egyptian restaurants have a habit of after being listed, cooking up a special English menu with vastly inflated prices. That said, cheap food can be found everywhere in street restaurants and snack stalls. The top notch restaurants are often, but not always, found in hotels and Nile boats. The borders between restaurants and cafes are not crystal-clear in the Egyptian capital. In many places it is perfectly acceptable to just have a drink or sheesha . Medium and high-range outlets might have a minimum charge. Cheaper restaurants will normally not serve alcohol as well as some more expensive outlets."
Cairo,Eat,,"In general, downtown is good for budget eating, while for higher quality eating you should head to Zamalek , Mohandiseen or any of the other more affluent parts of town."
Cairo,Eat,,"Traditional Egyptian staples are available almost everywhere. In stalls and street restaurants you will find traditional dishes like fūl (bean paste), falāfel , moussaka , koshari (rice, macaroni, lentils, chick peas and tomato sauce), feTīr (pancakes with different fillings) and shawarma (an import from Lebanon and Syria — pieces of roasted meat usually wrapped in bread). Cheaper places will only serve up vegetables and maybe beef hot dogs or corned beef. Eggs, fried potatoes and salads are also usually available. Hygiene varies wildly and the best advice is to go for the most visited places. Avoid empty restaurants as the food will be less fresh. Especially downtown, you can find many good koshari shops, including many outlets of the excellent Koshari Tahrir chain. Delicious and cheap fūl, falāfel, and shawarma sandwiches can be bought at the many outlets of popular Gad fast food chain dotted around Cairo. The average price for a tub of takeaway koshari is LE3-5, fūl or falāfel sandwiches is LE1-1.5, and shawarma sandwiches are LE4-8."
Cairo,Eat,,"In the medium and upper price range your choice of traditional Egyptian food will be more limited. Although the situation is improving, traditionally Egyptian gastronomical experiences are still mostly restricted to private homes. Quality chain restaurants like Felfela (several outlets), Abou El Sid (Zamalek, Maadi and Dokki), Cairo Kitchen (Zamalek and Maadi), and Abou Shakra offer authentic Egyptian food."
Cairo,Eat,,"Otherwise oriental or Middle Eastern restaurants tend to mix styles or completely go for more Lebanese-style eating, considered more stylish by rich Cairenes. The good side of this is that Cairo is blessed with many quality Lebanese outfits, from chains like Dar Al-Qamar to stylish restaurant establishments. Additionally, Turkish food and restaurants catering to Gulf visitors can be found."
Cairo,Eat,,"Cairo has a growing number of Western fast food outlets available - these are, incidentally, some of the best places to see young Cairenes relaxing together, as fast food restaurants are apparently considered among the hippest places to hang out. McDonalds [dead link] , Hardees [dead link] , Pizza Hut [dead link] , and KFC [dead link] are spread about the city, but they are relatively more expensive. Most of these also offer free wireless internet."
Cairo,Eat,,"The Tahrir Table 11 Tahrir square next to KFC. Owned by a Swedish lady, meals from locally inspired food to international dishes. View of Tahrir square in the second floor. Beer and wine served."
Cairo,Eat,,"Mo'men chain [dead link] , Cook Door the Egyptian equivalent of McDonald's has similar menu with similar prices and free wireless internet."
Cairo,Eat,,"Lighter meals like sandwiches and salads as well as pastries can be found in western-style bakeries and cafes. Popular chains like Cilantro , Beanos , Costa , and The Marriott Bakery as well as individual outlets all offer more or less similar dishes. Most of these places also offer free wireless internet."
Cairo,Eat,,"There is also a cute TGI Friday's [dead link] on the Nile banks at the entrance of Maadi, serving beer but no wine. Gezira also has its very own Chili's. For burgers, you can also try Fuddrucker's (Maadi and Mohandesseen) or Lucille's in Ma'adi (54 Road n° 9) which is owned by an American woman. Maison Thomas has several branches throughout Cairo, including Mohandiseen, Zamalek, and Maadi, and serves some of the best pizza in Cairo. There is an Italian place called the Mint in Mohandesseen 30 Gezirt Al Arab St. open 9AM-1:30AM, which boasts a very stylish interior, however it's alcohol free. If you prefer more stylish international dining, Cairo offers a wide variety: Italian, Chinese and Japanese outlets in addition to the ambiguous continental cooking abound, especially in areas like Zamalek, Mohandseen and Dokki. Rossini fish restaurant 66 Omar Ibn El Khatab ST +202 2291-8282, Cedars 42 Gezerit Al Arab Mohandeseen +202 3345-0088, this Lebanese restaurant is a favorite with Mohandesseen's ladies who can order grills and salads in a specious outdoor terrace."
Cairo,Eat,,"For health reasons it is advisable not to drink tap water or eat unpeeled fresh fruits and vegetables—at least for the first few days of the visit. There are few solely vegetarian options, L'aubergine in Zamalek is a good restaurant for vegetarian food. Otherwise, Egyptian cuisine is dominated by vegetable courses, but be aware of ""hidden"" meat in stock, sauces and the like. One should also be cautious about frozen drinks or ice creams sold outside of main hotels. Also, if served eggs, one should be cautious to ensure that they are fully cooked (sunny side up eggs may allow certain organisms to be transmitted)."
Cairo,Eat,,"The Metro chain and Alfa Market dotted around Cairo are convenient supermarkets. They often stock Western brands. Otherwise vegetables and fruit are plentiful and cheap. Bakeries such as The Bakery chain sell western-style bread and pastries. Organic food from the local ISIS brand is available at the supermarkets Metro and Carrefour and the Sekem Shop in Ahmed Sabri Street (شارع احمد صبر), Zamalek ."
Cairo,Eat,,"By far the cheapest and most satisfying option, buying from souks and outdoor markets makes for a crash course in Arabic and haggling, not to mention that the produce is often superb! Bread can be found on nearly every corner and comes in two types - whole wheat aysh baladi and white flour aysh shami . Both are baked fresh daily and delivered by thousands of kids on bicycles to every corner of the city. Every neighborhood has a few streets dedicated to produce and other goods. Always wash fruit thoroughly before eating. Eating a fresh Roma tomato in the heat of Summer straight from a market seller after being washed is a delight, hard to match. The fruits and vegetables in Egypt may not conform to EU or US standards of size, but their taste is far superior."
Cairo,Eat,,"Small bakeries ( furne ) sell every kind of baked good imaginable - ranging from Italian style bread sticks with nigella and sesame seeds to croissants, donuts and anything with dates in it. Fresh goods from these bakeries offers a nice alternative to the standard Egyptian breakfast of beans, beans, and beans, as well as the fact that this bread is very cheap."

Cairo,Drink,,"Cairo has a wide range of drinking options from the very traditional to fashionable and modern. At the other end of the scale, almost any street in Cairo has a traditional coffee house, ´ahwa, a traditionally male institution of social life tracing many hundreds of years back in history.

In addition to the traditional Turkish coffee and shai tea, virtually everywhere you'll find drinks like hibiscus tea kerkedeeh , served warm or cold depending on season, sahleb , a milk-based drink usually served in winter, fakhfakhenna (a kind of fruit salad), sugarcane juice, mango and tamarind juice, Tamr hindi ."
Cairo,Drink,,"Cairo remains one of the best cities in the world to sample the traditional coffee house culture of the region. They are called maqhâ in Standard Arabic, but in the local dialect this is turned into ´ahwa . The Turkish coffee remains an invariable ingredient in any Cairene coffee house, and water pipe ( sheesha ) and tea is even more popular. While considered ""old fashioned"" for a time, these places are again turning fashionable among younger crowds and even smoking a water-pipe is no longer a male-only pastime. Places vary from just a small affair—plastic chairs and tables put out on the street—to more elaborate cafes especially in upscale and tourist areas."
Cairo,Drink,,"When coffee was introduced to the Arab and Islamic world in the 1600s the Islamic clergy attempted to outlaw it. However people's cravings soon convinced the sheikhs against this, although even today the most pious followers of Islam would still avoid visiting an ´ahwa. For most Egyptian men however, it is an important social institution, usually near one's home and the local mosque or church. It is the place to chat, pick up the latest news, read the paper, watch a TV show or a soccer match, or simply people watch while puffing a waterpipe sheesha . Some say there are more than 20,000 coffee houses in Cairo. Today Downtown and Islamic Cairo are the best places to visit for a sampling of this essential part of Cairene life."
Cairo,Drink,,"For many, the sheesha or water pipe, is the main attraction of any visit to a Cairene coffee house. It is usually available in at least two varieties, mu´assal , pure tobacco, and tofâh , apple-flavored. Other fruit varieties are sometimes available. Coffee houses range from the more elaborately decorated to a simple counter and some plastic chairs and tables spread out in the street. Foreigners are invariably made welcome, although women might feel uncomfortable visiting coffee houses in traditional, poor areas of the city. However, in downtown and the tourist areas of Islamic Cairo single or women-only groups should not expect anything more than the ordinary hassle."
Cairo,Drink,,"Turkish coffee ( ´ahwe turki ) is served either sweet ( helwa ), medium sweet ( masbout ), with little sugar ( sukr khafeef ) or no sugar ( sâda ). Sweet means very sweet. Tea ( shai ) is served either as traditional loose tea ( kûshari , not to be confused with the Cairo macaroni-rice stample kushari ), known as dust tea in English, or in a tea bag. Most coffee shops usually offer fresh mint leaves to put in your tea, upon request. A range of soft drinks are usually available. Most typically you will find hibiscus tea ( karkadee ), served warm in the winter season and cold during the warmer parts of the year."
Cairo,Drink,,"During the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed. Basically these places sell fresh-pressed juice of whatever is in season. Typical choices include orange ( borto ' ân ), lemon ( lamūn ), mango ( manga ) and strawberry ( farawla ), guava ( gawafa ), pomegranate ( Rommân ). Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks."
Cairo,Drink,,"A health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general, food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. Some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water."
Cairo,Drink,,"Modern cafes and patisseries are spread out around the city. Typically they serve light food like sandwiches and salad in addition to espresso-based coffees and pastries. Many of these places are chains, like Cilantro, Beanos, Cinnabon, Orangette, the Bakery and Coffee Roastery. Most of these places, including all the chains mentioned above, offer wireless internet connection as well. International chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks are also widely available throughout Cairo."
Cairo,Drink,,"For the capital of a Muslim country, Cairo is relatively liberal when it comes to the consumption of alcohol. A wide range of bars and dance clubs is available, basically in every major hotel, and some are open 24/7.

For most Egyptian men however, it is an important social institution, usually near one's home and the local mosque or church. It is the place to chat, pick up the latest news, read the paper, watch a TV show or a soccer match, or simply people watch while puffing a waterpipe sheesha . Some say there are more than 20,000 coffee houses in Cairo. Today Downtown and Islamic Cairo are the best places to visit for a sampling of this essential part of Cairene life."
Cairo,Drink,Fruit juice stalls,"During the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed. Basically these places sell fresh-pressed juice of whatever is in season. Typical choices include orange ( borto ' ân ), lemon ( lamūn ), mango ( manga ) and strawberry ( farawla ), guava ( gawafa ), pomegranate ( Rommân ). Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks."
Cairo,Drink,Fruit juice stalls,"A health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general, food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. Some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water."
Cairo,Drink,Modern cafes and pastry shops,"Modern cafes and patisseries are spread out around the city. Typically they serve light food like sandwiches and salad in addition to espresso-based coffees and pastries. Many of these places are chains, like Cilantro, Beanos, Cinnabon, Orangette, the Bakery and Coffee Roastery. Most of these places, including all the chains mentioned above, offer wireless internet connection as well. International chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks are also widely available throughout Cairo."
Cairo,Drink,Nightlife,"For the capital of a Muslim country, Cairo is relatively liberal when it comes to the consumption of alcohol. A wide range of bars and dance clubs is available, basically in every major hotel, and some are open 24/7. If you would like to explore the less fancy drinking places in Cairo, Downtown is definitely the place to go. Upscale nightspots are found in and around the Zamalek area"
Cairo,Sleep,,"Cairo has a tremendous range of accommodation, from low-rent budget hotels downtown to five-star palaces along the Nile. See individual district articles for hotel listings."
Cairo,Sleep,,You can also stay in an accommodation in Giza directly at an entrance to the pyramid area. Many of these accommodations have a pyramid view.
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Scams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:"
Cairo,Stay safe,,"During politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be careful who you go with and under no circumstance let anyone push or guide you anywhere that you do not want to go! If you get lost look for the security and police officers. Many speak some English, and most know their local area very well as well as the tourist spots."
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Crossing streets is another major challenge in Cairo. Traffic lights, which only exist in a few locations, are routinely disregarded. In downtown Cairo, police officers may be controlling traffic at key intersections at busy times. Crossing the street is like playing the video game ""Frogger"", hurrying across the street one lane at a time, when there is a small break in traffic. One way to cross a street that proved to be effective is to place yourself next to an Egyptian who wants to cross the street and follow."
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Also, when riding in a taxi, the driver may go quite fast and drive erratically. If at any time you feel unsafe, tell the driver to stop and get out."
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Be careful about wearing the jerseys of local football clubs Al Ahly and Zamalek, as violent incidents have been known to occur between the supporters of both clubs."
Cairo,Stay safe,,"The place you're going to is closed, why don't you take my tour? (Taxi drivers may use this. You can avoid this by using Uber or Careem.)"
Cairo,Stay safe,,"You need help crossing the street? Come, let me help you!"
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Let me show you my shop, it's just on this corner. No this corner, no this corner, etc."
Cairo,Stay safe,,"Let me show you how to get to the mosque - no baksheesh, just LE50 to get in and go up to the roof. (Your new friend then tips the mosque guardian LE10 and pockets the rest.)"

London,description,,"Noisy, vibrant and truly multicultural, London is a megalopolis of people, ideas and frenetic energy. The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom sits on the River Thames in South-East England . Greater London has a population of a little over 9 million. Considered one of the world's leading ""global cities"", London remains an international capital of culture, music, education, fashion, politics, finance and trade. For the visitor, there is a seemingly endless choice of historical sites, shopping, museums, food, art galleries, nightlife, and activities. Once a Celtic settlement, London is a bustling city, where visitors come to experience the urban heritage and see its specific royal-themed attractions."
London,Districts,,"The name ""London"" used to refer only to the once-walled ""Square Mile"" of the original Roman and later medieval city; this is now confusingly called the "" City of London "" or just ""The City"". Today, London has taken on a much larger meaning to include all of the vast central parts of the modern metropolis, with the city having absorbed numerous surrounding towns and villages over the centuries, including large portions of the surrounding ""home counties"", one of which - Middlesex - being completely consumed by the growing metropolis. The term Greater London embraces Central London together with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one continuous urban sprawl within the lower Thames Valley. Though densely populated, London retains large swathes of green parkland and open space, even within the city centre."
London,Districts,,"Greater London is most of the area surrounded by the M25 orbital motorway, and consists of 32 London Boroughs and the City of London that, together with the office of the Mayor of London, form the basis for London's local government.

London,See,,"Central London hosts an outstanding collection of world-class museums and galleries, several of truly iconic status."
London,See,,"Even better, London is unique among global capitals in that the majority of the museums have no entrance charges, allowing visitors to make multiple visits with ease. Special or temporary exhibitions usually attract an admission charge."
London,See,,London museums and galleries with no general admission charge (free entry!) include:
London,See,,"Aside from these world famous establishments, there is an almost unbelievable number of minor museums in London covering a very diverse range of subjects. The British Government lists over 240 genuine museums in the city. A few notable examples:"
London,See,,"The ""green lungs"" of London are the many parks , great and small, scattered throughout the city including Hyde Park , St James Park and Regent's Park . Most of the larger parks have their origins in royal estates and hunting grounds and are still owned by the Crown, despite their public access."
London,See,,"English Heritage runs the Blue Plaques programme in London. Blue Plaques celebrate great figures of the past and the buildings that they inhabited. These are among the most familiar features of the capital’s streetscape and adorn the façades of buildings across the city. Since the first plaque was erected in 1867, the number has grown steadily and there are now more than 800. Recipients are as diverse as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Sigmund Freud, Charles de Gaulle, Jimi Hendrix and Karl Marx. Look out for these around the city."
London,See,,"Whereas some London museums offer free entry, some other top London attractions are ridiculously expensive. For example, entry to Westminster Abbey costs £20 per person (adult), and entry to the Tower is £21.50 per adult if bought online (2017). These prices can be sometimes mitigated by a purchase of London Pass, which needs to be done at the London Pass website . The pass comes in several varieties and gives access to over 60 attractions, including both Westminster Abbey and the Tower. For example, a day pass costs £62 for an adult (2017). The best strategy, if one wants to visit several expensive high-profile attractions, is to buy a day pass and to try visiting all of them in the same day. This requires some advanced planning and will not give you much time at each place you visit - for example, it can take an hour on public transport to travel between the Tower of London and London Zoo."
London,See,,"Buckingham Palace . The London residence of the King, in Westminster .

London,See,,"30 St Mary Axe or The Gherkin , a peculiarly-shaped 180 m (590 ft) building in the City. There is no public access to the building itself but it can be viewed from the roads and small paved areas directly in front of and behind the building . Security guards can be overzealous in this area and you may be asked to move on or stop taking photographs if you are doing so (although this may seem overbearing, it is private land and they can ask you to leave if they wish). Commanding views of this building can also be obtained from public roads near the site such as Leadenhall Street . Of minor interest to history fans is an inscription on Bury Street dedicated to a young Roman girl who was found buried here by archaeologists in 1995 .

London,See,Landmarks,"Buckingham Palace . The London residence of the King, in Westminster . Open for tours during the summer months only (in 2022 - from Jul 22 to Sep 30; tickets - https://tickets.rct.uk/product/date ), but a must-see sight even if you don't go in. (Tube: Green Park). Changing of the Guard spans three locations: Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and Wellington Barracks, and usually begins at 10:43 (check https://changing-guard.com/dates-buckingham-palace.html for details)."
London,See,Landmarks,"London Eye . The world's fourth-largest observation wheel, on the South Bank of the Thames with magnificent views over London. (Tube: Waterloo)"
London,See,Landmarks,Marble Arch is a white Carrara marble monument designed by John Nash. It is located in the middle of a huge traffic island at one of the busiest intersections in central London where Oxford Street meets Park Lane in Mayfair . (Tube: Marble Arch)
London,See,Landmarks,"Piccadilly Circus is one of the most photographed sights in London. The Shaftesbury Memorial, topped by the statue of Anteros (now popularly identified as Eros), stands proudly in the middle of Piccadilly Circus while the north eastern side is dominated by a huge, iconic neon advertising hoarding. Occasionally there will be scaffolding or fencing around the Eros statue in order to protect it during times when large crowds are anticipated. (Tube: Piccadilly Circus)"
London,See,Landmarks,"St Paul's Cathedral , also in the City , is Sir Christopher Wren's great accomplishment, built after the 1666 Great Fire of London - the great dome is still seated in majesty over the City. A section of the dome has such good acoustics that it forms a ""Whispering Gallery"". There is also a viewing area that offers views of the surrounding area including the Millennium Bridge that lies nearby. (Tube: St Paul's)"
London,See,Landmarks,"Tower Bridge . The iconic 19th century bridge located by the Tower of London near the City . It is decorated with high towers featuring a drawbridge. The public are allowed access to the interior of the bridge via the Tower Bridge Exhibition , tickets for which can be purchased online or at the bridge. (Tube: Tower Hill)"
London,See,Landmarks,"Tower of London . Situated just south east of the City , is London's original royal fortress by the Thames. It is over 900 years old, contains the Crown Jewels, is guarded by Beefeaters, and is a World Heritage site. It is also considered by many to be the most haunted building in the world. If you are interested in that sort of thing its definitely somewhere worth visiting. Sometimes there are guided ghost walks of the building. You can even have a good meal in one of the buildings on the property. (Tube: Tower Hill)"
London,See,Landmarks,"Trafalgar Square . Home of Nelson's Column and the lions, and once a safe haven for London's pigeons until the introduction of hired birds of prey. The ""Fourth Plinth"" has featured a succession of artworks since 1999. Overlooked by the National Gallery, it's the nearest London has to a ""centre"", and has been pedestrianised. (Tube: Charing Cross)"
London,See,Landmarks,"Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster , including the Elizabeth Tower (the clock tower commonly known by the name of its bell, Big Ben ) and the Houses of Parliament , in Westminster . The seat of the United Kingdom parliament and World Heritage site, as well as setting for royal coronations since 1066, including Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

London,See,Landmarks,"30 St Mary Axe or The Gherkin , a peculiarly-shaped 180 m (590 ft) building in the City. There is no public access to the building itself but it can be viewed from the roads and small paved areas directly in front of and behind the building . Security guards can be overzealous in this area and you may be asked to move on or stop taking photographs if you are doing so (although this may seem overbearing, it is private land and they can ask you to leave if they wish). Commanding views of this building can also be obtained from public roads near the site such as Leadenhall Street . Of minor interest to history fans is an inscription on Bury Street dedicated to a young Roman girl who was found buried here by archaeologists in 1995 . Her remains were moved to the Museum of London while the Gherkin was being constructed, and were reburied in 2007 at the original site. (Tube: Aldgate)"

These are among the most familiar features of the capital’s streetscape and adorn the façades of buildings across the city. Since the first plaque was erected in 1867, the number has grown steadily and there are now more than 800. Recipients are as diverse as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Sigmund Freud, Charles de Gaulle, Jimi Hendrix and Karl Marx. Look out for these around the city."
London,See,London Pass,"Whereas some London museums offer free entry, some other top London attractions are ridiculously expensive. For example, entry to Westminster Abbey costs £20 per person (adult), and entry to the Tower is £21.50 per adult if bought online (2017). These prices can be sometimes mitigated by a purchase of London Pass, which needs to be done at the London Pass website . The pass comes in several varieties and gives access to over 60 attractions, including both Westminster Abbey and the Tower. For example, a day pass costs £62 for an adult (2017). The best strategy, if one wants to visit several expensive high-profile attractions, is to buy a day pass and to try visiting all of them in the same day. This requires some advanced planning and will not give you much time at each place you visit - for example, it can take an hour on public transport to travel between the Tower of London and London Zoo."

London,Eat,,For suggestions of specific restaurants have a look into the district articles .
London,Eat,,"It is a huge task for a visitor to find the ""right place"" to eat in London – with the ""right atmosphere"", at the ""right price"" – largely because, as in any big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose, ranging from fast food joints, pubs, and mainstream chains all the way up to some of the most exclusive restaurants in the world which attract the kind of clientele that don't need to ask the price. Sorting the good from the bad isn't easy, but London has something to accommodate all budgets and tastes. As London is one of the world's most multicultural cities, it is possible to find virtually every cuisine from around the world here if you look hard enough."
London,Eat,,"Following is a rough guide to what you might get, should you fancy eating out:"
London,Eat,,Smoking is illegal in all enclosed and indoor public spaces in the UK.
London,Eat,,"Prices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food, in the opinion of many Londoners, is served at the various steak houses (Angus Steak House, Aberdeen Steak House, etc. – they are all dotted around the West End and near the main train stations). Londoners wouldn't dream of eating here – you shouldn't either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of knowledge are the streets around the British Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. Even the major fast food chains charge a premium in their West End outlets, so watch out."
London,Eat,,"Pubs in the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food although there are some brilliant ""gastro-pubs"" hidden away. In general, avoid all pubs that have graphic-designed and printed menus. Look around you – see any locals tucking in? No? Then you shouldn't either. The other rule to follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other part of Europe – is the menu available in multiple languages? If yes, then start running!"
London,Eat,,"In the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly in large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to benefit the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of chicken shops means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a drink shouldn't cost you more than £3 especially on Brick Lane . Brick Lane is also known for being home to London's version of the beigel (spelt ""bagel"" in the United States and Canada, but pronounced the same way), with Brick Lane Beigel Bake and Britain's First & Best Beigel Shop being among the sole remnants of what was once a thriving Jewish community in the neighbourhood. Both shops are also known for their salt beef , London's version of Jewish-style cured meats, and a popular filling in their beigel sandwiches. Another good (and cheap) lunch option is a chicken or lamb doner (gyro) at many outlets throughout the city, though meat quality is often poor."
London,Eat,,"For more authentic Cockney food, try pie and mash , which originates from the working-class in the East End. Usually minced beef and cold water pastry pie served with mashed potato, mushy peas and ""liquor"" gravy, it tastes a lot better than it sounds. Some of the best pie houses are M. Manze in Peckham or F. Cooke in Hackney Broadway Market. Water Souchet and London Particular (green-pea and ham) are classic Cockney soups, though hard to find on menus. For those game, jellied eels , pickled-cockles and whelks are all traditional London seafood. It's people's experiences in these kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food!"
London,Eat,,The South Bank 's Borough Market offers wholesale produce as well as individual stalls that sell small bites and drinks for a casual and cheap meal. Kappacasein Dairy has a popular stand in the market famous for their grilled cheese which has earned the praise of Giada De Laurentiis and Ruth Reichl.
London,Eat,,"Of course, the quintessential British dish fish and chips is widely available in London, but the standards can be pretty disappointing in the tourist trap pubs. The best-rated fish and chips shops in London are generally located in the suburbs, away from all the tourist fare in central London."
London,Eat,,"For hamburgers, local chain Burger & Lobster is an excellent choice for gourmet burgers."
London,Eat,,"Tipping may also be different than what you're used to. All meals include the 20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10–12%). The general rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10–15% which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider it polite to tip this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of service, is unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided."
London,Eat,,"While central London is full of restaurants and cafes, there are some areas where the majority of diners are Londoners, rather than tourists, and in general you will get a much more pleasant, better value, and less crowded eating experience than you will find in the West End.

London,Eat,,"As one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not better than in the countries of origin.

Sandwich shops are the most popular places to buy lunch, and there are a lot of places to choose from including the ubiquitous Pret a Manger. Some Italian-style sandwich shops have a very good reputation and you can identify them easily by looking at the long queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, central London has lots of mini-supermarkets operated by the big British supermarket chains (e.g., Sainsbury's, Tesco) where you can pick up a pre-packed sandwich."
London,Eat,,"Fast food with an Asian flair is easy to find throughout the city, with lots of Busaba Eathai, Wagamama, and Yo! Sushi locations throughout the city.

London,Eat,,"London has plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants many of them championing organic foodstuffs, and a quick search in Google will produce plenty of ideas, so you never have to see a piece of cooked meat all week.

London,Eat,,"If you are dining with carnivorous friends most restaurants will cater for vegetarians and will have at least a couple of dishes on the menu. Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are generally fruitful, as they have plenty of traditional dishes. Good Indian/Bangladeshi options can be found in the Brick Lane area of Spitalfields or further afield in East Ham, Tooting Broadway, and Southall. These also tend to be very cheap eats with authentically prepared dishes with a true local ambience. There are also many vegetarian Thai buffet places where you can eat fake meat in tooth-achingly sweet sauces for under £5. These can be found on Greek Street and Old Compton Street in Soho and Islington High Street ."
London,Eat,,"Mildred's is a great veggie chain with a handful of locations around London. If you're interested in vegan versions of classic British dishes, try ""fish"" and chips from Sutton and Sons in Hackney , and various cafes offer veggie interpretations of a full English breakfast."
London,Eat,,"Due to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater well for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal and Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are lots of Halal restaurants and shops all over London including Whitechapel Rd and Brick Lane in the East End , Bayswater, Edgware Rd and Paddington and in many parts of north London .

London,Eat,,"Up to £6 - you can get a good English pub or cafeteria breakfast with a rack of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange juice and coffee or tea. Most pubs stop this offer at 11AM, but there are literally hundreds of backstreet cafes (colloquially known as ""greasy spoons"") which will serve this sort of food all day. Most supermarket chains offer a ""meal deal"", consisting of a sandwich, a drink and a bag of crisps or fruit for £3–4 together, while buying the sandwich only can be the same price. If you are going to be on a budget for several days, the supermarkets are a good option."
London,Eat,,"£8 - will buy you a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, some takeaway fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also mostly Chinese restaurants which serve an all-you-can-eat buffet for around this price. These are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a member of public or a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These restaurants make much of their revenue on drinks although these are usually still moderately priced. The food while not being of the finest standard is usually very tasty and the range of dishes available is excellent. There are literally thousands of so-called takeaways in London and are a cheap alternative to a restaurant meal. Check with your hotel management if they allow food deliveries before ordering in. Most takeaways offer some form of seating, but this is usually very limited."
London,Eat,,"£6–10 - will get you a good pub meal and drink or a good Chinese/Indian/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Many pubs have a buy-one-get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for yourself or bring a friend."
London,Eat,,"£15 - some more expensive French, Mediterranean and international restaurants do cheaper two or three course lunch menus."
London,Eat,,"£25 - offers you a lot more choice. You can have a good meal, half a bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of modest restaurants that cater for this bracket."
London,Eat,,"£50 (to almost any amount!) - with more money to spend you can pick some of the city's finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like Michel Roux, Jr, or Gordon Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using the finest ingredients. Worth the splurge to impress a special someone. These establishments often need to be booked well in advance, and most will enforce a dress code of some sort, like Rules of Covent Garden, the oldest restaurant still extant."

London,Drink,Pubs and bars,"For the best view in the city, try pubs on the banks of the Thames. The South Bank has lots of good bars with views of iconic bridges and buildings. One lesser-known cocktail bar sits in the OXO Tower, which is a secret that most tourists walk by every day. Heading towards Bermondsey , pub crowds become a little less touristy. For something historic try the Prospect of Whitby' in Wapping which has been on its site since 1520 and claims to be the world’s oldest riverside tavern."
London,Drink,Pubs and bars,"If you're after gastropubs, you may like to visit London's first, The Eagle , in Clerkenwell , established in 1991. You can also try Time Out ' s favourite newcomer, The Princess Victoria on Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush ."
London,Drink,Pubs and bars,"The ""Bermondsey Beer mile"" is home to many craft breweries which are open in the middle of the day most Saturdays. Situated under the railway arches on lines going to London Bridge, these quaint breweries are home to high quality beer at cheap to average London prices (~£2 per half). Best places include Kernel Brewery and Brew by Numbers."
London,Drink,Pubs and bars,"Wine buffs can enjoy the famous Davys wine bars that dot the city. The company, established in 1870, import wines and own over thirty bars in the centre. Other big names in wine include the Michelin-starred Cellar Gascon and Vinoteca , both in Smithfield . For a posh wine tasting experience, there is Vinopolis by Borough Market, though a tour price will be as eye-watering as the produce sampled."
London,Drink,Pubs and bars,"Big hotels, such as The Langham, The Dorchester and The Ritz, and upmarket clubs around Leicester Square and Soho are reliable bets for a date at the bar. The Connaught Hotel in Mayfair-Marylebone boasts its house bar, plus the Time Out magazine favourite, The Coburg. Still in Mayfair, The Polo Bar at The Westbury is very intimate."

London,Drink,Nightclubs,Nightlife is an integral part of London life and there are countless nightclubs in and around Central London with music to suit even the most eclectic of tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize in different types of music.
London,Drink,Nightclubs,"The Farringdon/Hoxton/Shoreditch area has many clubs playing drum and bass, techno, house and trance music and is home to the superclub Fabric. The clubs in this area are often home to the world's top DJs and attract a lively, hip and friendly crowd. Big name drum and bass, house and techno DJs also appear at clubs scattered around Kings Cross (Egg, Scala), Elephant (Ministry of Sound, Corsica Studios), Southwark (Cable), Whitechapel (Rhythm Factory), or at mixed nights at the Vauxhall clubs. Nights are also hosted in disused Hackney warehouses or south London car parks."
London,Drink,Nightclubs,"The area around Mayfair is home to the more upmarket clubs in London. This area attracts a rather more showy crowd who love to flaunt what they have and is a must go to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive and many clubs operate a guestlist-only policy. Music played here is often of the commercial chart, funky house, hip hop and R&B genre. Notable clubs include China White, Luxx, Maddox, Jalouse, Funky Buddha, Whisky Mist, Mahiki, No 5 Cavendish Square, Embassy, Vendome and Maya."
London,Drink,Nightclubs,"Nightclubs around the Leicester Square area hold the same music policy, but are rather more accessible, with numerous club and pub crawl promoters scattered around the area offering deals on entry. Notable clubs are Cafe De Paris, 1 Big Night Out pub crawl, Penthouse, Sound, Tiger Tiger, Zoo bar and Ruby Blue."
London,Drink,Nightclubs,"The Camden area is home to clubs which play Indie, metal and rock music and notably the Electric Ballroom, the world-famous Koko (Fridays) and Underworld. Camden clubs are mostly shut (or empty) on the weekdays. In South London, London's Afro-Caribbean centre Brixton is home to numerous venues with all kinds of music, including a particular presence in reggae, ska, afrobeat, hiphop, and dubstep. There are also venues in Peckham and New Cross."

London,Sleep,,"London has hundreds of options for accommodation to suit all budgets from hostels through historic bed and breakfasts (B&Bs), mainstream chain hotels and apartments all the way to some of the most exclusive luxury hotels in the world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges where a stay in a top suite will cost upwards of £1,000 per night. The average cost of hotel accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city. Prices invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football/rugby fixtures), or other important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance."
London,Sleep,,"In general, most people tend to stay within ""Zone 1"" of the underground, however do your research carefully - sometimes being that extra five minutes away from a station can make the difference in cost and quality of local food and drinking options. In any case, you can always catch a bus anyway - by far the best way to see the city and get about generally. If you stay outside of Zone 1, TfL's travel time map shows which locations have good public transport."
London,Sleep,,"Your budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to stay in. Tourist-standard prices range from £20-200 per person per night. Expect smaller than average rooms especially at the low end of this range. As a general rule, expect to pay between £75 and £150 per night for a two- or three-star hotel in the central area of the city. Many of the big name chain hotels now offer substantial discounts (with rates often down as low as £30-£50 per room per night) if you book well in advance, but the drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of booking and there are no refunds if you cancel. The heart of the West End is the most expensive place to stay and most hotels are either four- or five-star and most will command a hefty price premium."
London,Sleep,,"The City and Canary Wharf can also be very expensive during the week, as they rely heavily on the captive business market, but prices often drop dramatically over the weekend when the business travel dries up. Booking there can be a good way of getting into a higher standard of accommodation than you could otherwise afford. However, much of the City becomes a ghost town over the weekend, and you will find that few bars and restaurants are open away from the main tourist attractions."
London,Sleep,,"Be exceptionally careful regarding the big ""budget"" hotel chains such as Premier Inn and Travelodge; prices for their London hotels (in contrast to elsewhere) can often meet or exceed those of other, better quality hotels, so it cannot just be assumed that you will get a good deal from them. Some of Travelodge's City of London hotels especially are of shockingly poor quality for the prices they charge."
London,Sleep,,"A top tip, however, is to always check the likes of LondonTown.com, Expedia and LateRooms as well as the hotel's own website since there are often deals to be had which can reduce the costs significantly."
London,Sleep,,"The extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to savings made by staying in a hotel further out near an Underground or railway station. Always be sure though to check where the closest Tube station is to your hotel. Staying further out will be cheaper but when travelling in allow 1-2 min per Tube stop (near the centre), around 2-3 min per stop (further out) and 5-10 min per line changes. This can easily total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end. There are many hotels close to transport hub stations such as Stratford, Greenwich, Ealing Broadway, Wimbledon and East Croydon."
London,Sleep,,"A more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick and easy train travel to London. For example, lively Brighton (otherwise known as 'London by Sea') is only an hour away, but your budget will go much further and there are excellent accommodation options."

Your best protection is to deal only with London apartment rental agencies which have been recommended by independent sources you feel you can trust, and to deal only with those that accept confirmations via credit card."

Most of the time these options are safe but it is important that guests and homeowners take equal precaution to ensure their valuables are safeguarded. Homeowners should always provide guests with terms and conditions of their live-in house rules to ensure there are no mishaps and both parties are at ease. This new trend allows guests to enjoy a less touristy version of London as most of these homes will be in residential areas which each have their own unique charm and experiences."

London,Stay safe,,"London has two of the oldest police forces in the world. The Metropolitan Police ( The Met ) is responsible for policing London except the tiny City of London , which is the responsibility of the City of London Police . In addition to these, the Tube and other railways are patrolled by the British Transport Police ."
London,Stay safe,,"On the whole, London is a safe place to visit and explore. Normal precautions for the safe keeping of your personal possessions, as you would in any other city, are suggested."
London,Stay safe,,"Like many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially begging, drug abuse and theft; mobile phones are a favourite target, often snatched by fast-moving moped riders. Make sure you have security and anti-theft features enabled on your phone as thieves are getting more sophisticated and will try to access your personal data and banking apps."
London,Stay safe,,"The police have placed significant resources in combating street level crime. Working in conjunction with borough councils and the City of London Corporation, they have brought the level of theft and pickpocketing in major retail areas in London to a manageable level. Pickpocketing in London is not as rampant as in other major European cities, though it still pays to be vigilant and take the usual precautions in securing your valuables."
London,Stay safe,,"Street gang culture is a growing problem in London as with many other cities in England. While most groups of youngsters are not likely to present any danger to tourists, some people feel the need to be slightly more vigilant in certain areas, especially certain outer suburbs. Violent crime is in general not common, but most typically occurs between members of rival gangs, rather than on random members of the public."
London,Stay safe,,"If you're planning to go out late at night and are worried about safety then try to frequent crowded areas such as the West End. There are always plenty of people on the street, even at 4AM. Generally, outside central London, the south, and east suburban areas are considered more dangerous, notably Brixton , Peckham and Hackney , although some parts of north-west London such as Harlesden and northern Camden are also known trouble spots."
London,Stay safe,,"The main problem throughout London to various degrees is drunken behaviour, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights and after football matches. Loud and rowdy behaviour is to be expected and fights and acts of aggression also occur. If you are harassed, it is best to simply ignore and walk away from those concerned. Trouble spots can be expected around popular drinking locations such as Soho and in various suburban centres."
London,Stay safe,,"London has a large number of con artists around, all trying to convince you to hand over your money one way or another. In general, you should never give cash or your bank/credit card detail to people on the street no matter how genuine they seem."
London,Stay safe,,"Cash machine/ATM scams : Most usage of these machines is perfectly safe, but there are various ways that thieves can either obtain your card or your cash when using an ATM. It is always safest to withdraw cash using a machine inside a bank, but street machines are usually more convenient. Before inserting your card visually check the machine for anything that looks odd. Thieves sometimes install cameras above the pin pad. If things look OK then reach out and wiggle the slot where you insert your card - if the slot's loose, don't put your card in, as there may be a device installed to trap your card. All good? OK, is there anyone standing too close to you or hovering nearby? If so, perhaps cancel the transaction and go elsewhere. If everything's good then go ahead! When obtaining your cash and retrieving your card hover your hand over the slot to be ready to grab them as soon as they come out. Is anyone trying to distract you? Don't let them and leave swiftly. If you notice anything odd about a cash machine or people nearby then phone the police on 101 (999 in an emergency) or report it to the premises the machine is attached to. Don't try to remove any devices yourself."
London,Stay safe,,"Cup and ball game : This variant of a scam dating back into antiquity is perhaps the most common and is frequently seen on the busier pedestrian bridges such as Westminster Bridge. A person will lay out a mat with three cups on it. They will pretend to hide a ball under one of the cups, move the cups around, and then ask you to place a bet on where the ball-containing cup has landed. There is no ball - the con artist will have spirited it away! This con always has people acting as lookouts in the crowd and they will pretend to win every now and again so it looks like the game is winnable. Also beware if you are just stopping to watch as you could be pick-pocketed! The best defence is to walk straight past these events and not engage at all. If you have a mobile phone/cellphone that works in the UK you can phone the police on 101 (the non-emergency equivalent to 999) and report them, but it is advised to move away to do this as you may be harassed by the con artist or their lookouts if they overhear you."
London,Stay safe,,"Overzealous street performers : Most street performers are happy to just do their thing, let you watch, and then you can throw them a few coins if you liked the show. However, some street performers will actively grab and harass passers-by in order to get attention and money. They may forcefully pose with you and ask you to take a photograph and then demand money for the photo opportunity. They may also take this opportunity while you're distracted to pick-pocket you. Don't engage with any street performer who is pushy or forceful - try to walk away, or call out ""Get off me!"" or ""No!"" and draw attention to yourself if you can't escape easily. Again, you can report these bogus street performers on the 101 number as above."
London,Stay safe,,"Tissue sellers on trains : Beggars will get onto a train and place tissues on the seats with a note begging for money. They want you to feel pity for them and buy the tissues, but this is an organised scam and the money goes towards criminal enterprises. If you see this happening on a train don't buy the tissues and ignore anyone who asks you for money for them. If you're above ground you can text the British Transport Police on 61016 to report it."
London,Stay safe,,"""Clip joint"" : Every night, Soho presents a particular danger: the ""clip joint"". The usual targets of these establishments are lone male tourists. Usually, an attractive woman will casually befriend the victim and recommend a local bar or even a club that has a ""show"". The establishment will be near-desolate, and, even if the victim has only a drink or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If payment is not immediately provided, the bouncers will lock the ""patrons"" inside and take it by force or take them to an ATM and stand over them while they extract the cash. To be safe, if a woman you just met suggests you go to a specific place, try to recommend a different bar. If she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her suggestions. Sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink (like a ""private show"" or sex for a small amount of money). A ""hostess fee"" will appear on the bill for several hundred pounds, even though there has been nothing more than polite conversation."
London,Stay safe,,"""Stress tests"" : If anyone offers you a free ""stress test"", they are likely trying to recruit you into the Church of Scientology. The best option is to walk away or just say "" No thank you "" politely, as people are commonly harassed into giving personal details."
London,Stay safe,,"Needing money for phone/train tickets/the bus/et al. : Someone will approach you asking for money for public transport. They will claim that they have lost their Travelcard or that it has been damaged somehow. Most people upon losing their Travelcard will seek aid at a train station and not approach random strangers! Another variant of this scam exists wherein a man or woman will ask for change so they can make a call at a phone box. Occasionally a person with a very convincing fake injury will ask for money so that they can get a taxi to hospital, strangely refusing the offer of you calling an ambulance or the police for them as you would do for most injured people in the street. Ignore them."
London,Stay safe,,"Ticket machine scam : One of the most popular scams in London is the ticket machine scam: While buying a ticket at a train station someone will approach you and act as if they want to help you buy the right ticket. In reality, they will wait until your money is in the machine, then lean across, cancel the transaction and pocket your cash. Say ""No thanks"" politely - you know what ticket you want to buy!"
London,Stay safe,,"Selling/asking for a donation for ""lucky heather"" : This scam, usually operated by women, involves someone handing you ""lucky heather"" (a small flower usually wrapped in foil) and then either trying to sell it to you or asking for a monetary donation. They will come up with a vague charity (""money for sick children"", ""money for orphaned babies"", and so on) and show you a purse full of supposed ""donations"". If you are handed one of these flowers either hand it back or drop it on the ground and leave. Be aware that you if you take the flower and leave without ""donating"" you could be chased and harassed by the people involved in the scam."
London,Stay safe,,Pedicabs : A common sight in central London is a brightly lit rickshaw blaring loud music and offering rides. They are not regulated and often seriously overcharge their passengers.
London,Stay safe,,"Although not illegal, London is a known hotspot for charity collectors, some of whom can be extremely persuasive in trying to obtain a donation; therefore they have earned the name ""charity muggers"" or ""chuggers"". If you do not want to donate, be polite but forceful, and under no circumstances provide any form of bank details. Some of these collectors are genuine scammers and are not collecting on behalf of any charity - larger charities ask their collectors to have specific and verifiable identification, and have card machines."
London,Stay safe,,"Don't take illegal minicabs (see Get around for details). No minicabs are allowed to ply for trade on the street, and any doing this should be avoided."
London,Stay safe,,"Travelling on the lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are more passengers around, and you are visible to the bus driver."
London,Stay safe,,"If you've lost an item on the Underground, Overground or Docklands Light Railway, in a licensed black cab, or on a red London bus then you should contact the TfL Lost Property Office as soon as possible. If an item is lost or misplaced on other transport services in London, the relevant service operator should be contacted."
London,Stay safe,,"Bank, credit and debit cards, when found, are securely destroyed. Contact your bank immediately if you lose these on a transport service."
London,Stay safe,,Keep valuables out of sight . Many crimes are opportunistic - a lot of mobile phones are snatched from restaurant tables. By keeping items such as cash and mobile phones out of sight theft can easily be prevented. Don't flash your cash unnecessarily!
London,Stay safe,,"Keep bags zipped up and close to your body . If your bag is hanging open it's like putting up a flashing neon sign saying ""Steal from me!"" Use zips and inside pockets to secure items wherever possible. Never leave valuables such as mobile phones, wallets, or travel documents in an outside section of your bag."
London,Stay safe,,"Be aware of your surroundings . Before using your mobile phone have a look around you. Put your back against something solid such as a wall or window so you can't be approached from behind. If you're in a train or Tube station try to use your phone before leaving as all stations have CCTV. Constantly look around you, especially if you are in a busy area. Don't walk and talk/text!"
London,Stay safe,Crime,"Like many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially begging, drug abuse and theft; mobile phones are a favourite target, often snatched by fast-moving moped riders.

London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"London has a large number of con artists around, all trying to convince you to hand over your money one way or another. In general, you should never give cash or your bank/credit card detail to people on the street no matter how genuine they seem."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Cash machine/ATM scams : Most usage of these machines is perfectly safe, but there are various ways that thieves can either obtain your card or your cash when using an ATM. It is always safest to withdraw cash using a machine inside a bank, but street machines are usually more convenient. Before inserting your card visually check the machine for anything that looks odd. Thieves sometimes install cameras above the pin pad. If things look OK then reach out and wiggle the slot where you insert your card - if the slot's loose, don't put your card in, as there may be a device installed to trap your card. All good? OK, is there anyone standing too close to you or hovering nearby? If so, perhaps cancel the transaction and go elsewhere. If everything's good then go ahead! When obtaining your cash and retrieving your card hover your hand over the slot to be ready to grab them as soon as they come out. Is anyone trying to distract you? Don't let them and leave swiftly. If you notice anything odd about a cash machine or people nearby then phone the police on 101 (999 in an emergency) or report it to the premises the machine is attached to. Don't try to remove any devices yourself."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Cup and ball game : This variant of a scam dating back into antiquity is perhaps the most common and is frequently seen on the busier pedestrian bridges such as Westminster Bridge. A person will lay out a mat with three cups on it. They will pretend to hide a ball under one of the cups, move the cups around, and then ask you to place a bet on where the ball-containing cup has landed. There is no ball - the con artist will have spirited it away! This con always has people acting as lookouts in the crowd and they will pretend to win every now and again so it looks like the game is winnable. Also beware if you are just stopping to watch as you could be pick-pocketed! The best defence is to walk straight past these events and not engage at all. If you have a mobile phone/cellphone that works in the UK you can phone the police on 101 (the non-emergency equivalent to 999) and report them, but it is advised to move away to do this as you may be harassed by the con artist or their lookouts if they overhear you."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Overzealous street performers : Most street performers are happy to just do their thing, let you watch, and then you can throw them a few coins if you liked the show. However, some street performers will actively grab and harass passers-by in order to get attention and money. They may forcefully pose with you and ask you to take a photograph and then demand money for the photo opportunity. They may also take this opportunity while you're distracted to pick-pocket you. Don't engage with any street performer who is pushy or forceful - try to walk away, or call out ""Get off me!"" or ""No!"" and draw attention to yourself if you can't escape easily. Again, you can report these bogus street performers on the 101 number as above."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Tissue sellers on trains : Beggars will get onto a train and place tissues on the seats with a note begging for money. They want you to feel pity for them and buy the tissues, but this is an organised scam and the money goes towards criminal enterprises. If you see this happening on a train don't buy the tissues and ignore anyone who asks you for money for them. If you're above ground you can text the British Transport Police on 61016 to report it."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"""Clip joint"" : Every night, Soho presents a particular danger: the ""clip joint"". The usual targets of these establishments are lone male tourists. Usually, an attractive woman will casually befriend the victim and recommend a local bar or even a club that has a ""show"". The establishment will be near-desolate, and, even if the victim has only a drink or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If payment is not immediately provided, the bouncers will lock the ""patrons"" inside and take it by force or take them to an ATM and stand over them while they extract the cash. To be safe, if a woman you just met suggests you go to a specific place, try to recommend a different bar. If she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her suggestions. Sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink (like a ""private show"" or sex for a small amount of money). A ""hostess fee"" will appear on the bill for several hundred pounds, even though there has been nothing more than polite conversation."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"""Stress tests"" : If anyone offers you a free ""stress test"", they are likely trying to recruit you into the Church of Scientology.

London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Needing money for phone/train tickets/the bus/et al. : Someone will approach you asking for money for public transport. They will claim that they have lost their Travelcard or that it has been damaged somehow. Most people upon losing their Travelcard will seek aid at a train station and not approach random strangers! Another variant of this scam exists wherein a man or woman will ask for change so they can make a call at a phone box. Occasionally a person with a very convincing fake injury will ask for money so that they can get a taxi to hospital, strangely refusing the offer of you calling an ambulance or the police for them as you would do for most injured people in the street. Ignore them."
London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Ticket machine scam : One of the most popular scams in London is the ticket machine scam: While buying a ticket at a train station someone will approach you and act as if they want to help you buy the right ticket.

London,Stay safe,Scams and cons,"Selling/asking for a donation for ""lucky heather"" : This scam, usually operated by women, involves someone handing you ""lucky heather"" (a small flower usually wrapped in foil) and then either trying to sell it to you or asking for a monetary donation. They will come up with a vague charity (""money for sick children"", ""money for orphaned babies"", and so on) and show you a purse full of supposed ""donations"". If you are handed one of these flowers either hand it back or drop it on the ground and leave. Be aware that you if you take the flower and leave without ""donating"" you could be chased and harassed by the people involved in the scam."

Rome,description,,"Rome ( Italian and Latin: Roma ), the 'Eternal City', is the capital and largest city of Italy and of the Lazio region. It's the famed city of the Roman Empire , the Seven Hills, La Dolce Vita , the Vatican City and Three Coins in the Fountain . Rome, as a millennia-long centre of power, culture and religion, was the centre of one of the greatest civilisations ever, and has exerted a huge influence over the world in its circa 2500 years of existence."
Rome,description,,"The historic centre of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

Rome,See,,"Italians are very fond of their landmarks; in order to make them accessible to everyone one week a year there is no charge for admittance to all publicly owned landmarks and historical sites. This week, known as "" La settimana dei beni culturali "", typically occurs in mid-May and for those 7 to 10 days every landmark, archaeological site and museum belonging to government agencies (including the Quirinale presidential palace and gardens, the Colosseum and all of the ancient Forum) is accessible and free of charge."
Rome,See,,Government-owned museums and historical sites have free admission on the first Sunday of every month.
Rome,See,,"If you'll be staying in Rome for at least 3 days, consider purchasing the Roma Pass . It is valid for 3 days and costs €58.50 (Aug 2024). It entitles holders to free admission to the first two museums and/or archaeological sites visited, full access to the public transport system, and discounts for the other museums, tourist sites, exhibitions, music events, theatrical and dance performances. This pass gets you in to the Colosseum (Colosseo), Palatine Hill (Palatino Hill), the Baths of Caracalla (Terme di Caracalla), and the catacombs as well as the Terme di Diocleziano, Palazza Massimo alle Terme, Crypta Balbi, Palazzo Altemps, Villa dei Quintili, and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella."
Rome,See,,A Roma Pass 48-hours is also offered for €36.50 (Aug 2024) and is valid for 2 days. For this pass only the first museum and/or archaeological sites visited is free.
Rome,See,,"Check the expiration date at the back of the Roma Pass card. If the card's validity has expired it does not work in the metro's ticket gate. Be sure to buy the passes at official tourist offices. There are also small booths on the streets that sell tickets, but they could charge you a higher price."
Rome,See,,"Another advantage of the Roma Pass is that you can often skip the waiting queues if it's one of your first two free entrances. This way you can avoid, for example, a 1+ hour waiting time at the Colosseum."
Rome,See,,"There's an alternative pass called OMNIA Vatican and Rome [dead link] that includes the services provided by Roma Pass, free entry to Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, fast track entry to St Peter's Basilica and hop-on-hop-off bus tour for 3 days. It costs €113 for 3 days"
Rome,See,,"The main area for exploring the ruins of ancient Rome is in Rome/Colosseo either side of Via dei Fori Imperiali, which connects the Colosseum and Piazza Venezia. Constructed between 1931 and 1933, at the time of Mussolini, this road destroyed a large area of Renaissance and medieval buildings constructed on top of ruins of the ancient forums and ended forever plans for an archaeological park stretching all the way to the Appian Way. Heading towards the Colosseum from Piazza Venezia, you see the Roman Forum on your right and Trajan's Forum and Market on the left. To the right of the Colosseum is the Arch of Constantine and the beginning of the Palatine Hill, which will eventually lead you to ruins of the Flavian Palace and a view of the Circus Maximus (see Rome/Aventino-Testaccio ). To the left, after the Colosseum is a wide, tree-lined path that climbs through the Colle Oppio park. Underneath this park is the Golden House of Nero (Domus Aurea), an enormous and spectacular underground complex restored and then closed again due to damage caused by heavy rain. Further to the left on the Esquiline Hill are ruins of Trajan's baths."
Rome,See,,"In Old Rome you must see the Pantheon, which is amazingly well preserved considering it dates back to 125 AD. There is a hole constructed in the ceiling so it is an interesting experience to be there when it is raining. If you are heading to the Pantheon from Piazza Venezia you first reach Largo di Torre Argentina on your left. Until 1926 this was covered in narrow streets and small houses, which were razed to the ground when ruins of Roman temples were discovered. Moving along Corso Vittorio Emmanuelle and crossing the Tiber river into the Vatican area you see the imposing Castel Sant' Angelo, built as a Mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian. This is connected by a covered fortified corridor to the Vatican and served as a refuge for Popes in times of trouble."
Rome,See,,"South of the Colosseum are the Baths of Caracalla ( Aventino-Testaccio ). You can then head South-East on the old Appian Way, passing through a stretch of very well-preserved city wall. For the adventurous, continuing along the Appian Way ( Rome/South ) will bring you to a whole host of Roman ruins, including the Circus of Maxentius, the tomb of Cecilia Metella, the Villa dei Quintili and, nearby, several long stretches of Roman aqueduct."
Rome,See,,"Returning to the Modern Centre , the Baths of Diocletian are opposite the entrance to the main railway station, Termini. The National Museum of Rome stands in the South-West corner of the Baths complex and has an enormous collection of Roman sculptures and other artefacts. But this is just one of numerous museums devoted to ancient Rome, including those of the Capitoline Hill. It is really amazing how much there is."
Rome,See,,There are more than 900 churches in Rome; probably one third would be well worth a visit!
Rome,See,,"In Catholic tradition, St. Peter is said to have founded the church in Rome together with St. Paul. The first churches of Rome originated in places where early Christians met, usually in the homes of private citizens. By the IVth Century, however, there were already four major churches, or basilicas. Rome had 28 cardinals who took it in turns to give mass once a week in one of the basilicas. In one form or another the four basilicas are with us today and constitute the major churches of Rome. They are St Peter's , St Paul's Outside the Walls , Santa Maria Maggiore and San Giovanni .  All pilgrims to Rome are expected to visit these four basilicas, together with San Lorenzo fuori le mura , Santa Croce in Gerusalemme , and the Sanctuary of Divino Amore . The latter was inserted as one of the seven at the time of the Great Jubilee in 2000, replacing San Sebastiano outside the walls ."
Rome,See,,"Take a look inside a few churches. You'll find the richness and range of decor astonishing, from fine classical art to tacky electric candles. Starting with several good examples of early Christian churches, including San Clemente and Santa Costanza , there are churches built over a period of 1700 years or so, including modern churches constructed to serve Rome's new suburbs."
Rome,See,,"Some churches in Rome deny admission to people who are dressed inappropriately.  You will find ""fashion police"" at the most visited churches. (""Knees and shoulders"" are the main problem - especially female ones.) Bare shoulders, short skirts, and shorts are officially not allowed, but long shorts and skirts reaching just above the knee should generally be no problem.  However, it's always safer to wear longer pants or skirts that go below the knee; St. Peter's in particular is known for rejecting tourists for uncovered knees, shoulders, midriffs, etc.  (You also generally won't be told until right before you enter the church, so you will have made the trek to the Vatican and stood in a long security line for nothing.)  The stricter churches usually have vendors just outside selling inexpensive scarves and sometimes plastic pants.  But relatively few churches  enforce dress codes and you can wander into most wearing shorts, sleeveless shirts, or pretty much anything without problems.  It is, however, good to keep one's dress tasteful, as these are still churches and houses of prayer for many people. (Older Romans might comment on your attire and perhaps harass you if it is particularly revealing.)"
Rome,See,,"To the modern visitor, the Seven Hills of Rome can be rather difficult to identify. In the first place generations of buildings constructed on top of each other and the construction of tall buildings in the valleys have tended to make the hills less pronounced than they originally were. Secondly, there are clearly more than seven hills. In Roman days many of these were outside the city boundaries."
Rome,See,,The seven hills were first occupied by small settlements and not recognised as a city for some time. Rome came into being as these settlements acted together to drain the marshy valleys between them and turn them into markets and fora. The Roman Forum used to be a swamp.
Rome,See,,"The Palatine Hill looms over Circus Maximus and is accessed near the Colosseum . Legend has it that this was occupied by Romulus when he fell out with his brother, Remus, who occupied the Aventine Hill on the other side of the Circus. Also clearly recognisable as hills are the Caelian , to the southeast of Circus Maximus and the Capitoline , which overlooks the Forum and now hosts the Municipality of Rome. East and northeast of the Roman Forum are the Esquiline , Viminal, and Quirinal hills . These are less easy to distinguish as separate hills these days and from a distance look like one."
Rome,See,,"The red line on the map indicates the Servian Wall, its construction is credited to the Roman King Servius Tullius in the Sixth Century BC, but archaeological evidence places its construction during the Fourth Century BC. Small bits of this wall can still be seen, particularly close to Termini railway station and on the Aventine hill . As Rome expanded new walls were required to protect the larger area. These were built in the Third Century AD by the Emperor Aurelian. Lengthy sections of this wall remain all around the outskirts of Rome's centre. Much is in very good condition."
Rome,See,,"Among other hills of Rome, not included in the seven, are that overlooking the Vatican ; the Janiculum overlooking Trastevere , which provides excellent views of Rome; the Pincio on the edge of the Borghese Gardens , which gives good views of the Vatican, and the Monte Mario to the north."
Rome,See,,"If you are in Rome for the Arts there are several world-class museums in the city. The natural starting point is a visit to the area of Villa Borghese in Rome/North Center , where there is a cluster of art museums in and around the Borghese Gardens. Galleria Borghese houses a previously private art collection of the Borghese family, Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia is home of the world's largest Etruscan art collection, and Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna houses many Italian masterpieces as well as a few pieces by artists such as Cézanne, Degas, Monet and Van Gogh."
Rome,See,,"The Capitoline Museums in the Colosseo district opens their doors to the city's most important collection of antique Roman and Greek art and sculptures. Visit the Galleria d'Arte Antica , housed in the Barberini palace in the Modern centre , for Italian Renaissance and Baroque art."
Rome,See,,"A visit to Rome is not complete without a trip to the Vatican Museum . You need to go to the museum if you want to see the Sistine Chapel, but there is an enormous collection. You cannot miss part of this, such as tapestries, maps and the rooms painted by Rafael, as they are en route to the Sistine Chapel, but there is much, much more to explore, including a stunning Egyptian collection, and the Pinacoteca, which includes a Portrait of St. Jerome by Leonardo da Vinci and paintings by Giotto, Perugino, Raphael, Veronese, Caravaggio, and others."
Rome,See,,"Rome's National Museum at the Baths of Diocletian in the Modern Centre has a vast archaeological collection as does the national museum at Palazzo Altemps , close to Piazza Navona . Further afield, the Museo di Civilta Romana (Museum of Rome's Civilization), in EUR is most famous for an enormous model of Imperial Rome, but also has an extensive display of plaster casts, models and reconstructions of statues and Roman stonework."
Rome,See,,"If you have plenty of time there is absolutely no shortage of other museums covering a wide variety of interests. Examples include the Museum of the Walls (see Rome/South ), the Musical Instrument Museum and a museum devoted to the liberation of Rome from German occupation in the Second World War ( Rome/Esquilino-San Giovanni )."
Rome,See,,"Check museum opening hours before heading there. Government museums are invariably closed on Mondays, so that is a good day for other activities. The Rome municipality itself operates some 17 museums and attractions. Info at Musei In Comune Roma [dead link] . These are free to European Union citizens under 18 and over 65. Websites for other museums are listed on the relevant District pages."
Rome,See,,"Much of the attraction of Rome is in just wandering around the old city. You can quickly escape from the major tourist routes and feel as if you are in a small medieval village, not a capital city. If you can do so while watching for uneven cobblestones, keep looking upwards. There are some amazing roof gardens and all sorts of sculptures, paintings and religious icons attached to exterior walls. Look through 2nd and 3rd floor windows to see some oak-beamed ceilings in the old houses. Look through the archway entrances of larger Palazzos to see incredible courtyards, complete with sculptures, fountains and gardens. Take a stroll in the area between Piazza Navona and the Tiber river in Old Rome where artisans continue to ply their trade from small shops. Also in Old Rome , take a 1 km (0.62 mi) stroll down Via Giulia , which is lined with many old palaces. Film enthusiasts will want to visit Via Veneto (Via Vittorio Veneto) in the Modern Centre , scene for much of Fellini's La Dolce Vita ."
Rome,See,,"The narrow streets frequently broaden out into small or large squares (piazzas), which usually have one or more churches and a fountain or two. Apart from Piazza Navona and Piazza della Rotonda (in front of the Pantheon), take in the nearby Piazza della Minerva , with its unique elephant statue by Bernini and Piazza Colonna with the column of Marcus Aurelius and Palazzo Chigi, meeting place of the Italian Government. On the other side of Corso Vittorio Emanuele are Piazza Farnese with the Palazzo of the same name (now the French Embassy) and two interesting fountains and the flower sellers at Campo dei Fiori , scene of Rome's executions in the old days. All of these squares are a short distance from each other in Old Rome . The enormous Piazza del Popolo in the North Centre , which provided an imposing entrance to the city when it represented the northern boundary of Rome, is well worth a visit. A short walk back towards the centre brings you to Piazza di Spagna at the foot of the Spanish Steps. Yet another fascinating fountain here. The area was much used as backdrop for the 1953 film Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck."
Rome,See,,"On the other side of the river is, of course, the magnificent square of St Peter's at the Vatican . Further south, in Trastevere is Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere , a great place to watch the world go by, either from one of the restaurants or bars that line two sides of the square or, if that is too expensive, from the steps of the central fountain. The square attracts many street entertainers."
Rome,See,,"Moving back to the Modern Centre you have to see the Trevi Fountain , surely a part of everyone's Roman holiday. Visitors are always amazed that such a big and famous fountain is tucked away in a small piazza in the middle of side streets. Take extra-special care of your possessions here. Further up the Via del Tritone you will come to Piazza Barberini , now full of traffic but the lovely Bernini fountain is not to be missed."
Rome,See,,"EUR provides a selection of Fascist Architecture, including the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana , often referred to ""the Square Colosseum."" It was designed to honour the historic Colosseum. This would be an interesting place to visit after seeing the Colosseum to compare their differences and similarities."
Rome,See,,"With no tall buildings in Rome, views of the city come from climbing the many hills, either the original seven hills of Rome or others that surround them. The two most popular views of Rome are from the Janiculum hill overlooking Trastevere and the Pincio at the edge of the Borghese Gardens . The former, best reached by car, has sweeping views of the centre of Rome, as long as the authorities remember to prune the trees on the hillside in front of the viewpoint. Cross over the piazza for an excellent view of the dome of St Peter's . The Vatican is the main sight from the Pincio (metro Line A, Piazza del Popolo, and then a good climb). Less popular, but just as nice, is the orange grove at Parco Savello on the Aventine Hill . Even less popular among tourists, as it is better accessed by car or moped, it the small square in front of the Zodiaco Restaurant in Monte Mario, a very popular spot for young Roman couples."
Rome,See,,"If you are planning some serious sightseeing then leave the kids with their grandparents! They don't take kindly to being dragged from ruin to ruin and church to church. A common sight in Rome is miserable looking kids traipsing after their parents. Also, push chairs/buggies are difficult to use because of the cobbled streets. If you are a family, do not try to do too much. It will be a big strain on kids and in the end everyone will be tired."
Rome,See,,"Apart from the major attractions Rome has relatively little to entertain kids. If you noticed a big Ferris wheel on your way in from Fiumicino Airport, think again. Lunapark at EUR was closed down in 2008. A few of the other ways to bribe your kids, however, are:"
Rome,See,,"Children's Museum . Via Flaminia 82. Just north of Piazza del Popolo. Controlled entrance at 10.00, 12,00, 15.00 and 17.00 for visits lasting 1 hour 45 minutes. Closed Mondays and for much of August. Best to check the web site for up-to-date info and to book in advance. Hands-on science, mainly for pre-teens, housed in a former tram-car depot."
Rome,See,,Bioparco . The renamed Rome Zoo. On the edge of the Borghese Gardens ( North Centre ).
Rome,See,,"The Time Elevator [dead link] . Via dei Santi Apostoli, 20 on a side street between Piazza Venezia and the Trevi Fountain. Daily 10.30 to 19.30. ""Five-dimensional"" shows on the Origins of Life and on the History of Rome, plus ""The House of Horrors"". Not for the faint-hearted: your seats move all over the place. Kids love it."
Rome,See,,"Rome's Wax Museum . 67 Piazza di Santi Apostoli, next to Piazza Venezia. Few good reports about this museum. Comments invited."
Rome,See,,Planetarium . This also has an excellent astronomy museum and is conveniently next to the Museum of Rome's Civilization ( EUR ).
Rome,See,,"The Vatican is, by and large, not a great idea for kids although they often enjoy the Sistine Chapel and are impressed by the beauty and the fact that it was all done in just four years. However, the Sistine Chapel is very crowded and getting there through the corridors of the Vatican Museum is even worse. It is easy for families to get separated so determine a meeting point. The best part of St. Peter's Basilica is that kids can go to the top of the dome. It is 500 steps but you can take the elevator up to the third floor. From there there are another 323 exhausting steps. So it is fun for older kids who can both climb up all the stairs and walk down as there is a huge line for the elevator ( Vatican )."
Rome,See,,"Zoomarine [dead link] . Dolphins, sea lions, exotic birds, splashy rides and swimming pools, some 20 km (12 mi) south of Rome near Pomezia. A good day out, but is this really why you came to Rome? Free transport from EUR and Pomezia railway station. Check web site for details."
Rome,See,Roma Pass,"If you'll be staying in Rome for at least 3 days, consider purchasing the Roma Pass . It is valid for 3 days and costs €58.50 (Aug 2024). It entitles holders to free admission to the first two museums and/or archaeological sites visited, full access to the public transport system, and discounts for the other museums, tourist sites, exhibitions, music events, theatrical and dance performances. This pass gets you in to the Colosseum (Colosseo), Palatine Hill (Palatino Hill), the Baths of Caracalla (Terme di Caracalla), and the catacombs as well as the Terme di Diocleziano, Palazza Massimo alle Terme, Crypta Balbi, Palazzo Altemps, Villa dei Quintili, and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella."

Rome,See,Ancient Rome,"The main area for exploring the ruins of ancient Rome is in Rome/Colosseo either side of Via dei Fori Imperiali, which connects the Colosseum and Piazza Venezia. Constructed between 1931 and 1933, at the time of Mussolini, this road destroyed a large area of Renaissance and medieval buildings constructed on top of ruins of the ancient forums and ended forever plans for an archaeological park stretching all the way to the Appian Way. Heading towards the Colosseum from Piazza Venezia, you see the Roman Forum on your right and Trajan's Forum and Market on the left. To the right of the Colosseum is the Arch of Constantine and the beginning of the Palatine Hill, which will eventually lead you to ruins of the Flavian Palace and a view of the Circus Maximus (see Rome/Aventino-Testaccio ). To the left, after the Colosseum is a wide, tree-lined path that climbs through the Colle Oppio park. Underneath this park is the Golden House of Nero (Domus Aurea), an enormous and spectacular underground complex restored and then closed again due to damage caused by heavy rain. Further to the left on the Esquiline Hill are ruins of Trajan's baths."
Rome,See,Ancient Rome,"In Old Rome you must see the Pantheon, which is amazingly well preserved considering it dates back to 125 AD. There is a hole constructed in the ceiling so it is an interesting experience to be there when it is raining. If you are heading to the Pantheon from Piazza Venezia you first reach Largo di Torre Argentina on your left. Until 1926 this was covered in narrow streets and small houses, which were razed to the ground when ruins of Roman temples were discovered. Moving along Corso Vittorio Emmanuelle and crossing the Tiber river into the Vatican area you see the imposing Castel Sant' Angelo, built as a Mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian. This is connected by a covered fortified corridor to the Vatican and served as a refuge for Popes in times of trouble."
Rome,See,Ancient Rome,"South of the Colosseum are the Baths of Caracalla ( Aventino-Testaccio ). You can then head South-East on the old Appian Way, passing through a stretch of very well-preserved city wall. For the adventurous, continuing along the Appian Way ( Rome/South ) will bring you to a whole host of Roman ruins, including the Circus of Maxentius, the tomb of Cecilia Metella, the Villa dei Quintili and, nearby, several long stretches of Roman aqueduct."
Rome,See,Ancient Rome,"Returning to the Modern Centre , the Baths of Diocletian are opposite the entrance to the main railway station, Termini. The National Museum of Rome stands in the South-West corner of the Baths complex and has an enormous collection of Roman sculptures and other artefacts. But this is just one of numerous museums devoted to ancient Rome, including those of the Capitoline Hill. It is really amazing how much there is."
Rome,See,Catholic Rome,There are more than 900 churches in Rome; probably one third would be well worth a visit!
Rome,See,Catholic Rome,"In Catholic tradition, St. Peter is said to have founded the church in Rome together with St. Paul. The first churches of Rome originated in places where early Christians met, usually in the homes of private citizens. By the IVth Century, however, there were already four major churches, or basilicas. Rome had 28 cardinals who took it in turns to give mass once a week in one of the basilicas. In one form or another the four basilicas are with us today and constitute the major churches of Rome. They are St Peter's , St Paul's Outside the Walls , Santa Maria Maggiore and San Giovanni .  All pilgrims to Rome are expected to visit these four basilicas, together with San Lorenzo fuori le mura , Santa Croce in Gerusalemme , and the Sanctuary of Divino Amore . The latter was inserted as one of the seven at the time of the Great Jubilee in 2000, replacing San Sebastiano outside the walls ."
Rome,See,Catholic Rome,"Take a look inside a few churches. You'll find the richness and range of decor astonishing, from fine classical art to tacky electric candles. Starting with several good examples of early Christian churches, including San Clemente and Santa Costanza , there are churches built over a period of 1700 years or so, including modern churches constructed to serve Rome's new suburbs."
Rome,See,Catholic Rome,"Some churches in Rome deny admission to people who are dressed inappropriately.  You will find ""fashion police"" at the most visited churches. (""Knees and shoulders"" are the main problem - especially female ones.) Bare shoulders, short skirts, and shorts are officially not allowed, but long shorts and skirts reaching just above the knee should generally be no problem.  However, it's always safer to wear longer pants or skirts that go below the knee; St. Peter's in particular is known for rejecting tourists for uncovered knees, shoulders, midriffs, etc.  (You also generally won't be told until right before you enter the church, so you will have made the trek to the Vatican and stood in a long security line for nothing.)  The stricter churches usually have vendors just outside selling inexpensive scarves and sometimes plastic pants.  But relatively few churches  enforce dress codes and you can wander into most wearing shorts, sleeveless shirts, or pretty much anything without problems.  It is, however, good to keep one's dress tasteful, as these are still churches and houses of prayer for many people. (Older Romans might comment on your attire and perhaps harass you if it is particularly revealing.)"
Rome,See,The Seven Hills of Rome,"To the modern visitor, the Seven Hills of Rome can be rather difficult to identify. In the first place generations of buildings constructed on top of each other and the construction of tall buildings in the valleys have tended to make the hills less pronounced than they originally were. Secondly, there are clearly more than seven hills. In Roman days many of these were outside the city boundaries."
Rome,See,The Seven Hills of Rome,The seven hills were first occupied by small settlements and not recognised as a city for some time. Rome came into being as these settlements acted together to drain the marshy valleys between them and turn them into markets and fora. The Roman Forum used to be a swamp.
Rome,See,The Seven Hills of Rome,"The Palatine Hill looms over Circus Maximus and is accessed near the Colosseum . Legend has it that this was occupied by Romulus when he fell out with his brother, Remus, who occupied the Aventine Hill on the other side of the Circus. Also clearly recognisable as hills are the Caelian , to the southeast of Circus Maximus and the Capitoline , which overlooks the Forum and now hosts the Municipality of Rome. East and northeast of the Roman Forum are the Esquiline , Viminal, and Quirinal hills . These are less easy to distinguish as separate hills these days and from a distance look like one."
Rome,See,The Seven Hills of Rome,"The red line on the map indicates the Servian Wall, its construction is credited to the Roman King Servius Tullius in the Sixth Century BC, but archaeological evidence places its construction during the Fourth Century BC. Small bits of this wall can still be seen, particularly close to Termini railway station and on the Aventine hill . As Rome expanded new walls were required to protect the larger area. These were built in the Third Century AD by the Emperor Aurelian. Lengthy sections of this wall remain all around the outskirts of Rome's centre. Much is in very good condition."
Rome,See,The Seven Hills of Rome,"Among other hills of Rome, not included in the seven, are that overlooking the Vatican ; the Janiculum overlooking Trastevere , which provides excellent views of Rome; the Pincio on the edge of the Borghese Gardens , which gives good views of the Vatican, and the Monte Mario to the north."
Rome,See,Museums,"If you are in Rome for the Arts there are several world-class museums in the city. The natural starting point is a visit to the area of Villa Borghese in Rome/North Center , where there is a cluster of art museums in and around the Borghese Gardens. Galleria Borghese houses a previously private art collection of the Borghese family, Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia is home of the world's largest Etruscan art collection, and Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna houses many Italian masterpieces as well as a few pieces by artists such as Cézanne, Degas, Monet and Van Gogh."
Rome,See,Museums,"The Capitoline Museums in the Colosseo district opens their doors to the city's most important collection of antique Roman and Greek art and sculptures. Visit the Galleria d'Arte Antica , housed in the Barberini palace in the Modern centre , for Italian Renaissance and Baroque art."
Rome,See,Museums,"A visit to Rome is not complete without a trip to the Vatican Museum . You need to go to the museum if you want to see the Sistine Chapel, but there is an enormous collection. You cannot miss part of this, such as tapestries, maps and the rooms painted by Rafael, as they are en route to the Sistine Chapel, but there is much, much more to explore, including a stunning Egyptian collection, and the Pinacoteca, which includes a Portrait of St. Jerome by Leonardo da Vinci and paintings by Giotto, Perugino, Raphael, Veronese, Caravaggio, and others."
Rome,See,Museums,"Rome's National Museum at the Baths of Diocletian in the Modern Centre has a vast archaeological collection as does the national museum at Palazzo Altemps , close to Piazza Navona . Further afield, the Museo di Civilta Romana (Museum of Rome's Civilization), in EUR is most famous for an enormous model of Imperial Rome, but also has an extensive display of plaster casts, models and reconstructions of statues and Roman stonework."
Rome,See,Museums,"If you have plenty of time there is absolutely no shortage of other museums covering a wide variety of interests. Examples include the Museum of the Walls (see Rome/South ), the Musical Instrument Museum and a museum devoted to the liberation of Rome from German occupation in the Second World War ( Rome/Esquilino-San Giovanni )."
Rome,See,Museums,"Check museum opening hours before heading there. Government museums are invariably closed on Mondays, so that is a good day for other activities. The Rome municipality itself operates some 17 museums and attractions. Info at Musei In Comune Roma [dead link] . These are free to European Union citizens under 18 and over 65. Websites for other museums are listed on the relevant District pages."
Rome,See,Just walking around,"Much of the attraction of Rome is in just wandering around the old city. You can quickly escape from the major tourist routes and feel as if you are in a small medieval village, not a capital city. If you can do so while watching for uneven cobblestones, keep looking upwards. There are some amazing roof gardens and all sorts of sculptures, paintings and religious icons attached to exterior walls. Look through 2nd and 3rd floor windows to see some oak-beamed ceilings in the old houses. Look through the archway entrances of larger Palazzos to see incredible courtyards, complete with sculptures, fountains and gardens. Take a stroll in the area between Piazza Navona and the Tiber river in Old Rome where artisans continue to ply their trade from small shops. Also in Old Rome , take a 1 km (0.62 mi) stroll down Via Giulia , which is lined with many old palaces. Film enthusiasts will want to visit Via Veneto (Via Vittorio Veneto) in the Modern Centre , scene for much of Fellini's La Dolce Vita ."
Rome,See,The Piazzas,"The narrow streets frequently broaden out into small or large squares (piazzas), which usually have one or more churches and a fountain or two. Apart from Piazza Navona and Piazza della Rotonda (in front of the Pantheon), take in the nearby Piazza della Minerva , with its unique elephant statue by Bernini and Piazza Colonna with the column of Marcus Aurelius and Palazzo Chigi, meeting place of the Italian Government. On the other side of Corso Vittorio Emanuele are Piazza Farnese with the Palazzo of the same name (now the French Embassy) and two interesting fountains and the flower sellers at Campo dei Fiori , scene of Rome's executions in the old days. All of these squares are a short distance from each other in Old Rome . The enormous Piazza del Popolo in the North Centre , which provided an imposing entrance to the city when it represented the northern boundary of Rome, is well worth a visit. A short walk back towards the centre brings you to Piazza di Spagna at the foot of the Spanish Steps. Yet another fascinating fountain here. The area was much used as backdrop for the 1953 film Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck."
Rome,See,The Piazzas,"On the other side of the river is, of course, the magnificent square of St Peter's at the Vatican . Further south, in Trastevere is Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere , a great place to watch the world go by, either from one of the restaurants or bars that line two sides of the square or, if that is too expensive, from the steps of the central fountain. The square attracts many street entertainers."
Rome,See,The Piazzas,"Moving back to the Modern Centre you have to see the Trevi Fountain , surely a part of everyone's Roman holiday. Visitors are always amazed that such a big and famous fountain is tucked away in a small piazza in the middle of side streets. Take extra-special care of your possessions here. Further up the Via del Tritone you will come to Piazza Barberini , now full of traffic but the lovely Bernini fountain is not to be missed."
Rome,See,Overlooked Places,"EUR provides a selection of Fascist Architecture, including the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana , often referred to ""the Square Colosseum."" It was designed to honour the historic Colosseum. This would be an interesting place to visit after seeing the Colosseum to compare their differences and similarities."
Rome,See,Viewpoints,"With no tall buildings in Rome, views of the city come from climbing the many hills, either the original seven hills of Rome or others that surround them. The two most popular views of Rome are from the Janiculum hill overlooking Trastevere and the Pincio at the edge of the Borghese Gardens . The former, best reached by car, has sweeping views of the centre of Rome, as long as the authorities remember to prune the trees on the hillside in front of the viewpoint. Cross over the piazza for an excellent view of the dome of St Peter's . The Vatican is the main sight from the Pincio (metro Line A, Piazza del Popolo, and then a good climb).

Rome,Buy,,"Rome has excellent shopping opportunities of all kinds - from clothing and jewellery to art and antiques. You also get some big department stores, outlets and shopping centres, notably in the suburbs and outskirts."
Rome,Buy,,"Main shopping areas include Via del Corso, Via Condotti, and the surrounding streets. The finest designer stores are around Via Condotti, whilst Via del Corso has more affordable clothing, and Via Cola di Rienzo, and the surroundings of Via del Tritone, Campo de'Fiori, and Pantheon are the places to go for cheaper items. Upim is a good shop for cheap clothing of workable quality. Some brands (like Miss Sixty and Furla) are excellent, some are not as good - be sure to feel garments and try them on. There are also great quality shoes and leather bags at prices that compare well with the UK and US. Clothes in sizes bigger than a UK size 16/US 12 aren't always easy to find. Children's clothing can be expensive with basic vests (tank tops) costing as much as €21 in non-designer shops. If you really need to buy clothiers for kids try the Oviesse chain. Summer sales in many stores begin around July 15 and Rome also has New Year sales."
Rome,Buy,,"As mentioned above, Via Condotti leading from the Spanish Steps towards the Tiber is Rome's top haute couture fashion street (equivalent of Fifth Avenue in New York City, Via Montenapoleone in Milan, or Bond Street in London). Here, you can find big brand names such as Gucci, Armani, Dior, Valentino and Hermès, and several other high-class shops. However, the streets around the Via Condotti, such as Via Frattina, Via del Babuino, Via Borgognona and the Piazza di Spagna also offer some excellent high fashion boutiques, including Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Prada and Givenchy (and several others). So once in the city, the big boutique names aren't absent. In these luxurious streets, however, you needn't only do clothing shopping - there are some really good and funky jewellery (e.g. Bulgari, Cartier, Tiffany's & Co.), pen and accessory (i.e. Mont Blanc) and artsy stores peppered here and there in these streets."
Rome,Buy,,"For department stores, Milan-based luxury department store chain La Rinascente has two flagship branches in Rome; one along Via de Tritone, near the Trevi Fountain, in which you can see the Roman aqueduct carrying water to the Trevi Fountain in the basement, and the other one on Piazza Fiume."

Rome,Eat,,"Rome is full of good restaurants, many in attractive settings, particularly when you sit outside in the evening. No one location can be recommended to search for a good restaurant: some of the best places to eat are in the most unpromising locations while well-situated restaurants can often live on their reputation rather than the quality of their food. Restaurants in guidebooks can be good but prices can be inflated because it is more than likely a ""tourist trap"". To find an authentic restaurant that won't break the bank, try to find a place in a more residential area or somewhere that isn't in the middle of the tourist locations."
Rome,Eat,,In Rome you can ask for:
Rome,Eat,,"Many of the good restaurants in Rome are hard to find, but a good tip is to go where Italians live and eat. The downside is that waitstaff at these restaurants usually do not speak English, so be prepared to have to speak some Italian. On the top of the green, old mountain (Monte Verde Vecchio) there are some trattorias with authentic Italian cuisine at an affordable price. Rome also has many beautiful spots to eat, so buying some delicacies to make up a picnic can be a great experience. In Via Marmorata you find Volpetti's which is known for its amazing selection of cheese, prosciutto and delicious pastries (and also for its prices!). A more affordable choice is to go to a local supermarket which will also have good fresh foods for lunch."
Rome,Eat,,"Most pizza restaurants serve it only in the evening. Try some of the fried things like baccala (battered salt cod) for a starter, followed by a pizza for a really Roman meal.  Roman pizzas tend to be very thin crusted. Avoid the tourist areas where you'll often pay double the going rate just to get a badly reheated frozen pizza. Your best bet is to cross the river and find a restaurant in Trastevere--the food is authentic and a lot cheaper than in the rest of downtown Rome. Make sure you eat it with a fork and knife; Romans don't eat this kind of pizza with their hands."
Rome,Eat,,"Pizza al Taglio is pizza with a thicker crust, cooked in a large pan. This is served by the piece, usually to take away, and is a good cheap way to get something to fill you up.  Point to the one you want, indicate if you want more or less than your server is indicating with the knife.  It's sold by weight (the listed price is usually per 100 g, known as an etto , short for ettogrammo , i.e. hectogram). This kind of pizza is eaten with the slices stacked on top of each other like a sandwich."
Rome,Eat,,"Look for a gelateria . Remember that it usually costs extra to sit inside. You pay for your ice cream first... take your receipt and go fight your way through the throng to choose your flavors (Italians don't believe in lines).  You will be asked "" Panna? "" when it's almost made - this is the offer of whipped cream on top.  If you've already paid, this is free."
Rome,Eat,,"There are a few signs to keep in mind: "" Produzione Propria "" (homemade - our own production), "" Nostra Produzione "" (our production), "" Produzione Artigianale "" (production by craftsmen). If the colours seem dull and almost ugly it is probably natural, the bright colours being just a mix. Also, fancy flavours like Kinder Egg chocolate is a dead giveaway that the place isn't about  traditional gelato. Keep in mind, Italians usually won't queue, but if they are in line for gelato, get in line yourself: you may have hit the jackpot. Producers to try include Gelato di San Crispino ; Giolitti ; and Fassi ."
Rome,Eat,,"Vegetarians should have an easy time. Buffets in many restaurants usually have a good range of delicious vegetarian stuff - e.g. gratinated roast peppers/aubergines, etc. Vegans should do all right too; pizzas don't always have cheese - a Marinara for example, is just tomato, garlic and oregano."
Rome,Eat,,"While there is not much choice, at least Rome's Kosher cooking is truly excellent.  Try La Taverna del Ghetto in the heart of the Jewish Quarter."
Rome,Eat,,"More places can be found near the synagogue in via Padova, close to the ""La Sapienza"" university and the Bologna underground station."

Rome,Eat,,"€20 - At night you can spend about €20 at a pizza restaurant or if you have only one main course. Again, if you have special wine it will cost more. The cheapest food you can get at a decent restaurant is a pizza marinara (that is, without cheese) for about €6. The price goes up from there depending on the toppings."
Rome,Eat,,€20+ - For a sit down lunch or dinner in a restaurant €20 is cheap and if you want you can go up to €200 a head.
Rome,Eat,,"Eat like a Roman In Rome you can ask for: Carciofi alla romana - Artichokes, Roman style Carciofi alla giudia - Artichokes, Jewish style Puntarelle - Chicory salad Bucatini all'amatriciana - A pasta dish made with guanciale (cured pork cheeks), pecorino romano and tomatoes Spaghetti (or Rigatoni) alla carbonara - A sauce made with yolk, pecorino and guanciale (cured pork cheeks) Abbacchio a ""scottadito"" - Lamb chops Scaloppine alla romana - Veal sautéed with fresh baby artichokes Coda alla vaccinara - Oxtail stew Cornetto & cappuccino - Sweet pastry and coffee Pizza a taglio - Pizza by the slice Panino - Italian sandwich Trippa alla romana - Tripe in a sauce based on tomatoes, onions, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, wine or vinegar, etc. Fiori di zucca fritti - Deep-fried zucchini flowers"
Rome,Eat,Pizza,"Most pizza restaurants serve it only in the evening. Try some of the fried things like baccala (battered salt cod) for a starter, followed by a pizza for a really Roman meal.  Roman pizzas tend to be very thin crusted. Avoid the tourist areas where you'll often pay double the going rate just to get a badly reheated frozen pizza. Your best bet is to cross the river and find a restaurant in Trastevere--the food is authentic and a lot cheaper than in the rest of downtown Rome. Make sure you eat it with a fork and knife; Romans don't eat this kind of pizza with their hands."
Rome,Eat,Pizza,"Pizza al Taglio is pizza with a thicker crust, cooked in a large pan. This is served by the piece, usually to take away, and is a good cheap way to get something to fill you up.  Point to the one you want, indicate if you want more or less than your server is indicating with the knife.  It's sold by weight (the listed price is usually per 100 g, known as an etto , short for ettogrammo , i.e. hectogram). This kind of pizza is eaten with the slices stacked on top of each other like a sandwich."
Rome,Eat,Ice cream (gelato),"Look for a gelateria . Remember that it usually costs extra to sit inside. You pay for your ice cream first... take your receipt and go fight your way through the throng to choose your flavors (Italians don't believe in lines).  You will be asked "" Panna? "" when it's almost made - this is the offer of whipped cream on top.  If you've already paid, this is free."
Rome,Eat,Ice cream (gelato),"There are a few signs to keep in mind: "" Produzione Propria "" (homemade - our own production), "" Nostra Produzione "" (our production), "" Produzione Artigianale "" (production by craftsmen). If the colours seem dull and almost ugly it is probably natural, the bright colours being just a mix. Also, fancy flavours like Kinder Egg chocolate is a dead giveaway that the place isn't about  traditional gelato. Keep in mind, Italians usually won't queue, but if they are in line for gelato, get in line yourself: you may have hit the jackpot. Producers to try include Gelato di San Crispino ; Giolitti ; and Fassi ."
Rome,Eat,Vegetarians,"Vegetarians should have an easy time. Buffets in many restaurants usually have a good range of delicious vegetarian stuff - e.g. gratinated roast peppers/aubergines, etc. Vegans should do all right too; pizzas don't always have cheese - a Marinara for example, is just tomato, garlic and oregano."
Rome,Eat,Kosher dining,"While there is not much choice, at least Rome's Kosher cooking is truly excellent.  Try La Taverna del Ghetto in the heart of the Jewish Quarter."
Rome,Eat,Kosher dining,"More places can be found near the synagogue in via Padova, close to the ""La Sapienza"" university and the Bologna underground station."
Rome,Eat,Pricing,"You can get cheap food in Rome, the problem is that if you don't know the city well or are forced to eat out in the centre, the prices go up."
Rome,Eat,Pricing,"Chinese restaurants are still quite cheap but other ethnic restaurants (Thai, Indian) are generally expensive (think €30 upwards per person). Sushi is very expensive (€40 minimum per person)."
Rome,Eat,Pricing,Waiters have been known to take advantage of patrons by bringing more expensive items than what was ordered or asking for a tip although it's not mandatory and should be included in the price by law.
Rome,Eat,Pricing,"€3.50 - You buy the pizza and eat it walking around, since it's a bread shop with no sitting area. You can choose how much you want to eat, but you'll be spending about €2 per slice + about €1.50 for a can of soda or €1 for water."
Rome,Eat,Pricing,"€15-20 - At lunchtime if you go to a restaurant you'll be spending between €15 for a set menu (not always good, try to go where you see Italian office people having their lunch as your best bet) and €20.

Rome,Drink,,"Starbucks has long avoided Rome, but in April 2023 the first one appeared in the center of Rome. And no wonder: Italian coffee is great so our friends from Seattle would face a lot of competition. A latte in Italian is just a glass of milk.

""Espresso"" or ""normale"" is just that, but more commonly just referred to as caffe . Espresso doppio means a double shot of espresso, while espresso macchiato is espresso 'marked' with a dab of steamed milk. Americano — the one to order if you like filter coffee  — is espresso diluted with hot water and not drunk much by Italians. Cappuccino is well known outside of Italy, but be warned: it is considered very un-classy, and somewhat childish, to order one after 11AM  (and certainly after a meal).

Slightly better quality wines are usually sold at a relatively small mark-up on shop prices. Most Romans drink water with their meals. In restaurants it normally comes in 1 litre bottles and can be had normale (still water) or gassata (carbonated water)."
Rome,Drink,,"Water is free at designated water fountains , called ""nasone"" (big nose). Some of these date back to ancient times, and the water is still very good.

Rome,Sleep,,"The area to the southwest of Termini railway station has numerous large hotels; these are used in particular by groups and coach parties. On the other side of the station are many smaller, fairly inexpensive, hotels that are popular with individual travellers. Perhaps the best choice for a first-time visitor is to stay right downtown, (such as near the Pantheon ). Most attractions are walking distance from there, and you will save much transportation time and leave more for enjoying the city. Hotels in the downtown area are costly, but a good apartment is a decent alternative, especially for couples and if you don't mind cooking yourself from time to time: it will save even more of your budget."
Rome,Sleep,,"Offering of short term apartment rentals is enormous. Many apartments can be booked directly through the owner, but most owners make arrangements via rental agencies, both large and small.

Rome,Stay safe,,"Rome is generally a safe place, even for women traveling alone. However, there have been rape cases around the Roma Termini train station, so be careful especially at night time. There is very little violent crime, but plenty of scams and pickpocketing that target tourists. As in any other big city, it is better if you don't look like a tourist : don't exhibit your camera to all and sundry, and keep your money in a safe place. Consciousness and vigilance are your best insurances for avoiding becoming a victim of a crime in Rome. Remember, if you are pickpocketed or victim of another scam, don't be afraid to shout, ""Aiuto, al ladro!"" ( Help, Thief! ) Romans will not be nice to the thief."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Members of the Italian public are likely to be sympathetic if you are a crime victim. Police are also generally friendly if not always helpful. Carabinieri (black uniform, red striped trousers) are military police, and Polizia (blue and grey uniform) are civilians, but they both do essentially the same thing and are equally good, or bad. If you are robbed, try to find a police station and report it. This is essential to establishing a secure insurance claim and to replace documents: the chances of it resulting in the return of your possessions are, however, fairly remote."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Rome is home to two rival Serie A football (soccer) clubs, A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, and there is a history of conflict, and even rioting, between the two. Never wear anything that shows that you support either of them, especially during the Rome Derby (when the two clubs play each other, known in Italian as the Derby della Capitale ): avoid even wandering into groups of supporters of the other club, or you may be subject to heckling or even confrontation. Play it safe and refrain from openly supporting either club unless you are very familiar with the rivalry. If you are a fan of a foreign team that is playing in Rome, be very careful as a number of supporters have been stabbed over the past few years."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Rome has its fair share of odd people: talkative panhandlers, crazy taxi drivers, lonely people wanting to just have a chat with strangers, people trying to sell you things, and so on. If you don't want to acknowledge anyone, do what most Italian people do: completely ignore them, shoo them off, or simply say you don't have anything to give to them or you are not interested."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Since Rome is incredibly popular as a tourist destination, a great deal of pickpocketing and bag or purse snatching takes place, especially in crowded locations, and pickpocketers in Rome can get pretty crafty. A 2010 study found that Rome was second only to Barcelona for pickpocketing of tourists. As a rule, you should pretty much never carry anything very valuable in any outside pocket , especially the front pocket of your pants is one of the easiest and most common targets. Keeping your wallet in your front pocket or in your bag is far from safe. You should consider using a money belt and carry only the cash for the day in your pocket. Pickpocketing on the Metro is rife in the form of gangs of young girls (8 to 15 years old), often pregnant, who jump on the trains just as they are about to leave. They buffet you and have bags to hide where their hands are.
You have been warned!"
Rome,Stay safe,,"Also, beware of thieves—one popular technique that they use is to ride by you on a moped, slice the strap of a handbag with a knife, and ride off. They might also try to cut the bottom of your bag open and pick your wallet from the ground. Others will use the old trick of one person trying to distract you (asking for a cigarette or doing a strange dance) while another thief picks your pockets from behind. Bands of beggar kids will sometimes crowd you and reach for your pockets under the cover of newspapers or cardboard sheets. It is generally a good idea to be extremely wary of any strange person who gets too close to you, even in a crowd. If someone is in your personal space, shove the person away. As one frequent traveller put it, ""Don't be afraid to be a dick in Rome."" It is better to be rude than to be stolen from."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Termini (the main railway station), Esquilino, bus line 64 (Termini to San Pietro), and the Trevi fountain are well known for pickpockets, so take extra care in these areas. On the Metro especially, pickpockets are extremely skilled. Remember that hotel rooms are not safe places for valuables; if your room has no safe, give your  valuables to the hotel staff for safekeeping. Even if it does have a safe, hotels normally warn that they have no liability unless items are deposited in the main safe. Be wary while boarding or getting off the metro/train, especially if doors are about to close/closing. Thieves pretend to be helpful by pressing the 'door open' button for you, and while you gratefully squeeze into the train and catch your breath, they'll sidle up to you and pick your pocket or dip into your handbag or purse. Be aware of the danger and take the usual precautions and you should be all right."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Being one of the most visited cities in the world, tourist scams are rampant in Rome. Many of the more well-aware Italians are quite ashamed of this.

Rome,Stay safe,,"A particular scam is when some plainclothes police will approach you, asking to look for ""drug money,"" or ask to see your passport. This is a scam to take your money. You can scare them by asking for their ID. Guardia di Finanza (the grey uniformed ones) do customs work."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Another scam involves men working near the Spanish Steps, around Piazza Navona, and outside of the Colosseum. They approach you, asking where you are from, and begin to tie bracelets around your wrists. When they are done they will try to charge you upwards of €20 for each bracelet. If anyone makes any attempt to reach for your hand, retract quickly. If you get trapped, you can refuse to pay, but this may not be wise if there are not many people around.  Carry small bills or just change, in your wallet, so if you find yourself in cornered to pay for the bracelet, you can convince them that €1 or €2 is all you have."

Rome,Stay safe,,"Be careful of con-men who may approach you at tourist sights such as the Colosseum or Circus Maximus. A car may pull up next to you, and the driver asks you for directions to the Vatican. He will strike up a conversation with you while he sits in his car and tell you he is a sales representative for a large French fashion house. He will then tell that you he likes you and he would like to give you a gift of a coat worth several thousand euros. As you reach inside his car to take the bag the coat is in, he will ask you for €200 for gas, as his car is nearly empty. Around tourist sites like the Trevi Fountain, Colosseum and the Spanish Steps there are groups mostly of men trying to sell cheap souvenirs. They may also carry roses and say they are giving you a gift because they like you, but the minute you take their 'gift' they demand money. They are often very insistent and often the only way to get rid of them is to be plain rude. Do the best you can to not take their ""gifts"" as they will follow you around asking for money. Simply saying ""no"" or ""go away"" will get them off your back until the next vendor comes up to you."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Be wary of ticket touts outside popular tourist attractions such as the Colosseum.

A genuine staff member at an attraction you are visiting will never ask you to pay heaps of money just to skip the crowd, tell you inaccurate information about the place you are visiting, and so on. These touts are simply looking for ways to waste your time and fleece your money. Be warned that some of them can be quite pushy, so don't feel the need to be polite if you are being pestered by a tout. As a general rule, only buy tickets from official venues and always check the website (if they have one) of the place you intend to visit. As a tourist, you can do your part in making Rome an even better place by reporting these touts to the right authorities."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Be careful and wary of people who sell you fake products on the streets.

The people who sell you these fake products know it is illegal to sell fake products, but they do it anyways to make a living. Only buy from reputed stores."
Rome,Stay safe,,"Be wary of places to change currency. Read ALL signs before changing money.

The best bet is to change enough money before you leave your home country. There are few places around the city that are under the table and are just interested in American money. These places charge no service fee."

Rome,Stay safe,Pickpocketing,"Since Rome is incredibly popular as a tourist destination, a great deal of pickpocketing and bag or purse snatching takes place, especially in crowded locations, and pickpocketers in Rome can get pretty crafty. A 2010 study found that Rome was second only to Barcelona for pickpocketing of tourists. As a rule, you should pretty much never carry anything very valuable in any outside pocket , especially the front pocket of your pants is one of the easiest and most common targets. Keeping your wallet in your front pocket or in your bag is far from safe. You should consider using a money belt and carry only the cash for the day in your pocket. Pickpocketing on the Metro is rife in the form of gangs of young girls (8 to 15 years old), often pregnant, who jump on the trains just as they are about to leave. They buffet you and have bags to hide where their hands are.
You have been warned!"
Rome,Stay safe,Pickpocketing,"Also, beware of thieves—one popular technique that they use is to ride by you on a moped, slice the strap of a handbag with a knife, and ride off. They might also try to cut the bottom of your bag open and pick your wallet from the ground. Others will use the old trick of one person trying to distract you (asking for a cigarette or doing a strange dance) while another thief picks your pockets from behind. Bands of beggar kids will sometimes crowd you and reach for your pockets under the cover of newspapers or cardboard sheets. It is generally a good idea to be extremely wary of any strange person who gets too close to you, even in a crowd. If someone is in your personal space, shove the person away. As one frequent traveller put it, ""Don't be afraid to be a dick in Rome."" It is better to be rude than to be stolen from."
Rome,Stay safe,Pickpocketing,"Termini (the main railway station), Esquilino, bus line 64 (Termini to San Pietro), and the Trevi fountain are well known for pickpockets, so take extra care in these areas.

Seoul,description,,"Seoul (서울) is the capital of South Korea . With a population of over 9 million (with over 20 million in the wider metropolitan area), Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural centers. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a dynamic trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts, contradictions, and paradoxes. People in Seoul can enjoy various artistic activities such as plays, musicals, and concerts."
Seoul,Districts,,"Administratively, Seoul is divided into 25 districts (구 gu ), each with an area and population comparable to a small city. The districts are then further subdivided into 522 sub-districts (동 dong ). The Han river splits the city into two halves: Gangbuk (강북), the northern, more historical half, and Gangnam (강남), the southern, wealthier and more modern half. The sheer size of the city means that travelers to Seoul will find it difficult to locate a true ""center"" of Seoul; instead, Seoul is almost more like a collection of cities that happen to be bunched together, each with their own central business and commercial districts. The two largest core areas are Jongno/Jung in the north, and Gangnam in the south. For travelers with more time, there are many more, smaller centers and districts to be explored, such as the island of Yeoui-do and the college district of Hongdae/Sinchon. For the typical traveler, it would be useful to divide the city into the following areas:"
Seoul,Districts,,"Jongno (종로) ( Jongno-gu ) The Joseon-era historical core of the city with the famous Joseon Palace, Gyeongbokgung. Bukchon has beautiful traditional Korean house and Insa-dong has the largest antiques market street in Seoul. Cheongyecheon has a renovated stream and park that runs through the heart of the downtown area."
Seoul,Districts,,"Jung (중) ( Jung-gu ) This district makes up the other half of the historic core as well as the shopping districts of Myeongdong and Namdaemun Market. This area contains Seoul Station and Namsan Mountain, with the Seoul Tower at its summit."
Seoul,Districts,,"Seodaemun & Mapo (서대문/마포) ( Seodaemun-gu, Mapo-gu ) These two districts lie immediately west of Jongro and Jung, and contain dozens of universities and colleges. As such, this area is home to some of Seoul's most active nightlife districts: Hongdae (홍대) and Sinchon (신촌)."
Seoul,Districts,,"Yongsan (용산) ( Yongsan-gu ) Yongsan is home to the US Army Military Base as well as one of the huge Yongsan Electronics Market. This is also where you'll find Itaewon (이태원), perhaps the most culturally diverse area in Korea and home to dozens of restaurants featuring cuisine from the world over, numerous shops selling everything from custom-tailored suits to antiques, and several Western pubs and bars."
Seoul,Districts,,"Yeongdeungpo & Guro (영등포 / 구로) ( Yeongdeungpo-gu, Guro-gu ) Covering Yeoui-do on the Han River as well as an area on the south side, this is often referred to as the 'Manhattan of Seoul'. Guro is one of the IT venture company clusters."
Seoul,Districts,,"Gangnam & Seocho (강남 / 서초) ( Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu ) Famed for 'Gangnam Style', this affluent area is the glitzy center of modern Seoul, home to hundreds of glass and steel skyscrapers, neon billboards, and some of the most expensive real estate in the country."
Seoul,Districts,,"Songpa & Gangdong (송파 / 강동) ( Songpa-gu, Gangdong-gu ) A residential district east of Gangnam where you'll find Lotte World, Olympic Park, Seoul (Jamsil) Sports Complex, and the Sincheon nightlife district."
Seoul,Districts,,"North ( Nowon-gu, Seongbuk-gu, Gangbuk-gu, Dobong-gu, Eunpyeong-gu ) Northern area including Eunpyeong, Seongbuk, Gangbuk, Dobong and Nowon. Mt. Bukhansan and Mt. Dobongsan area."
Seoul,Districts,,"South ( Dongjak-gu, Gwanak-gu, Geumcheon-gu ) Area south of the Han river including Dongjak, Gwanak and Geumcheon. This is where you can enjoy fresh seafood at the huge Noryangjin fish market."
Seoul,Districts,,"East ( Jungnang-gu, Gwangjin-gu, Seongdong-gu, Dongdaemun-gu ) Dongdaemun, Jungnang, Gwangjin, Seongdong with greenery and some interesting cultural sites."
Seoul,Districts,,"West ( Gangseo-gu, Yangcheon-gu ) Western area south of the Han river and including Gangseo and Yangcheon"
Seoul,See,,"Seoul is a vast, vibrant cityscape, set against an airy backdrop of mountains. It includes a standout collection of attractions with a blend of old and new."
Seoul,See,,"While Seoul today is mostly known as a super-modern mega-city that is home to skyscrapers, malls, and millions of electronic-mad Koreans, the city contains over 2,000 years of history. The city contains 4 UNESCO sites marking important monuments from its 505 years as the capital of the Joseon Dynasty. Originally a walled city with 20 ft (6.1 m) stone walls and narrow lanes inside. Though many buildings were destroyed or damaged during the violent events of the first half of the 20th century, much of its historic core remains. So, anyone staying in Seoul should visit the many historical treasures the city has to offer, including the many palaces and city gates within the Jongno district."
Seoul,See,,"Seoul has been a capital of Korea since the Joseon Dynasty. Starting from the Gyeongbokgung, many palaces were built for kings and royal family. The most important of them are called Five Grand Palaces (5대궁). Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest and most important palace, and is also the site of the Joseon Palace Museum and Korean Folk Museum . The main gate of the palace, Gwanghwamun , and its plaza are the center of Seoul. Changdeokgung , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , was the most favored residential palace of the Joseon Royal Family. It also has the beautiful garden named Secret Garden (Also was called 'Forbidden Garden'). Changgyeonggung and Gyeonghuigung are less famous due to extensive damage sustained after the fall of the Joseon Dynasty; Changgyeonggung was once a zoo, and Gyeonghuigung was once a high school. Finally, Deoksugung was used during the last years of the monarchy. It has a harmony of both traditional and western building design. All of these palaces have a thicker, more informative pamphlet for ₩500, which is worth the cost."
Seoul,See,,"There are several traditional spots in Seoul besides palaces. Jongmyo Shrine is where the kings of the Joseon Dynasty are enshrined, and the Jongmyo Jerye ceremony, in which descendants of the Joseon royal family honor their ancestors, is held here every year.

Seoul,See,,"Seoul is full of parks. Along the Han River (Hangang, 한강), there are Hangang Citizen's Park . It is in many districts, and each have a distinct spots. You can cycle along the river or buy a snack or souvenir at the night market. Among those, Banpo Hangang Park is most famous. You can see the fountain on the Banpo bridge, go to Some Sevit (an artificial floating island), or exercise at the Seorae island."
Seoul,See,,"There are several unique parks that were repurposed from other uses. Seoul Forest was changed from a racecourse to a park with deer and a greenhouse. Olympic Park was built on ancient fortification walls, and holds many venues used in the 1988 Olympics. Worldcup Park was a landfill, but was turned into a large park with a soccer stadium, and is famous for silver grass. Seonyudo Park was a water filtration plant and was changed to ecological park above the remnants of old tanks and reservoirs. Other famous parks include Children's Grand Park and Dream Forest . Haneul Park is one of the largest parks in Seoul."
Seoul,See,,"Seoul is also surrounded by many mountains (san, 산). You can hike along the people and feel the nature in the middle of city. Notable mountains are Namsan (남산), Gwanaksan (관악산), Bukhansan (북한산), Suraksan (수락산)."
Seoul,See,,"Seoul has been a capital for more than 600 years, and has a lot of museums. The most important museum is definitely National Museum of Korea at Yongsan. This houses the highlight of 5,000 years of Korean history and its exquisite treasures.

Seoul,See,,"Gyeongbokgung Palace. In 1-91, Sejongno, Jongno-gu. The Gyeongbokgung, which means ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven."", was built in 1395 in Joseon Dynasty. It was the heart of Joseon Dynasty because the government ministry district was focused here. Even after it was razed by the Japanese during Hideyoshi invasions of 1592–1598, it was reconstructed in 1876, only for many buildings to be razed again by the Japanese during the occupation from 1910–1945. Nevertheless, Gyeongbokgung remains one of the most magnificent and historically most significant places in Seoul, and restoration to its pre-Japanese occupation state continues to be take place at a painstaking pace. It opens everyday except Tuesday. There is also a free guide tour for tourists every day (English : 11:00, 13:30, 15:30).

Hongik University boasts Korea's most famous art school, thus fashion in this area is often influenced by the students' artistic sensibilities. The shops in this area feature funky, punky, boho, and vintage style. Ewha Women's University also has a big shopping area in front of its main gate, as do many of the Women's colleges. Many trends also originate here. There are even seamstresses who can help you make your own designs come to life."
Seoul,Buy,Fashion,"Seongsu also is rapidly becoming the center of fashion in Seoul. It was once an industrial complex, but now it's home to new fashions such as hip-hop, reggae, vintage, and gukdu, as the abandoned factories have been redecorated by young people. Nearby is Ttukseom Hangang Park, where you can enjoy Korea's famous fried chicken and beer."
Seoul,Buy,Duty free,"South Korea is a major shopping destination for Chinese and Japanese these days, with many dedicated duty-free shops available in Seoul. Korean Won, Japanese Yen and US dollars are accepted, along with major credit cards. Most shops have staff who can speak Japanese. There are duty-free shops in both the Incheon airport and the major department stores: Lotte, Shilla Hotel. There are other duty-free shops at Walkerhill Hotel, SKM DFS in COEX Mall."
Seoul,Eat,,"Much of Korean social life revolves around food and the city is packed with restaurants, so you would have to be determined to starve to death in Seoul. This fate may still befall you if you insist on English menus and meals consisting only of easily identifiable, familiar ingredients, so see South Korea#Eat for a quick Korean menu reader. An alternative is to just point and eat, your hosts generally will accommodate. If you look in the right places, a good meal (lunch or dinner) including side dishes can cost ₩5,000 or less (try basements of large department stores)."
Seoul,Eat,,"In addition to Korean food, Japanese restaurants in Seoul tend to be excellent, featuring excellent sushi and sashimi. Chinese restaurants exist, but are typically adapted to suit local preferences. There are a few Italian restaurants; these are generally excellent, with chefs trained in Italy, although flavors tend to be more or less Koreanized, with sugar in the garlic bread and meatballs."
Seoul,Eat,,"Bakeries are found throughout, including some of the common big chains."
Seoul,Eat,,"Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including: mandu, odeng, ddeokbokki, naengmyeon, udong and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about ₩2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul.  These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality.  Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere)."
Seoul,Eat,,"Don't be surprised if you find yourself with 5 plates even though you only ordered one, most main dishes are served banchan , side dishes such as kimchi , fermented vegetables with spices, and soup to rinse your palate before and/or after eating. While this is great, this could also be the reason why some restaurants doesn't accept solo dining, especially in Korean BBQ, since the portions might be too much for a single person; always make sure to ask if it's ok to eat alone by telling them “han myung” – a table for one person."
Seoul,Eat,,"Public trash bins around Seoul are rare. If you're eating street food, you can hand back leftover trash, like skewers, to the food vendors or throw it away in their trash bags. Some leave a box for trash in front of their stand. Other places to find trash bins are restrooms and convenience stores."

Seoul,Drink,,"Seoul features a mind-bogglingly large array of nightspots catering to every taste and budget. Hongdae and Sinchon in Seodaemun-Mapo are Seoul's most active nightlife districts. Itaewon in Yongsan is Seoul's international district, with a wide variety of Western-styled venues to eat and drink. Since many foreigners congregate there, Itaewon remains somewhat of a niche nightlife area for Koreans interested in a more international scene. Itaewon is also home to the highest concentration of gay bars in Seoul, in an alleyway known as ""Homo Hill"". Much nightlife in Seoul revolves around soju. Soju is a traditional Korean spirit that comes in many varieties, including original and many kinds of fruit-flavored soju."
Seoul,Sleep,,"Seoul has two unofficial backpacker districts, Jongno (Anguk/Sinseol-dong) to the northeast of the city and Hongdae-Sinchon out to the west.

Seoul,Stay safe,,"Seoul is a remarkably safe city despite its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo . Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is very rare. There are very few places where CCTV cameras are absent."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"If you happen to be a non-Korean man walking hand-in-hand with a Korean woman, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. This is far less of a problem than it used to be."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"If you do end up in a fight and the attacker gets hurt, the fact that you didn't start the fight may not give you legal protection."

Seoul,Stay safe,,"Unfortunately, crimes by American soldiers against Koreans do happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a Westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Protesting : Large-scale demonstrations against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in violence where there are pitched battles between protesters and combat police. People do get seriously hurt, so try to avoid getting too close to the action."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Fake monks have been known to operate in Seoul, notably around the Jogyesa temple. They are dressed as Buddhist monks requesting donations from people on the street in return for blessings, although they do not actually belong to any Buddhist order and just keep the cash for themselves. Actual monks would never seek donations in this manner. If you want to donate money, put it into the donation box in temples."
Seoul,Stay safe,,"Scams: Be wary of Korean people randomly coming to teach you about Korean culture and inviting you to try a Korean tradition in their studio. They tend to be very friendly to foreigners, offer to try a traditional Korean outfit and see a real-life Korean ceremony and then ask for money during or after it is done."
