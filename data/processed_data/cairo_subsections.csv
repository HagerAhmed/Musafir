Cairo,Egypt,Africa,description,,"Cairo (pronounced KY-roh ; Arabic : القاهرة al-Qāhirah ) is the capital of Egypt (until the New Administrative Capital is completed) and, with a total population of Greater Cairo metropolitan area in excess of 16 million people, one of the largest cities in both Africa and the Middle East (the regions which it conveniently straddles). It is also the 19th largest city in the world, and among the world's most densely populated cities."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,description,,"On the Nile river, Cairo is famous for its own history, preserved in the fabulous medieval Islamic city and Coptic sites in Old Cairo — with historic Cairo inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list . The Egyptian Museum in the city centre is a must see, with its countless Ancient Egyptian artefacts, as is shopping at the Khan al-Khalili bazaar. No trip to Cairo would be complete without a visit to the Giza Pyramids and to the nearby Saqqara Pyramid Complex , where visitors will see Egypt's first step pyramid built by the architect Imhotep for the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,description,,"Though firmly attached to the past, Cairo is also home to a vibrant modern society. The Midan Tahrir area situated in downtown Cairo, built in the 19th century under the rule of Khedive Ismail, has strived to be a ""Paris on the Nile"". There also are a number of more modern suburbs including Ma'adi and Heliopolis , while Zamalek is a quiet area on Gezira Island , with upmarket shopping. Cairo is best in the autumn or spring, when the weather isn't so hot. A felucca ride on the Nile is a good way to escape from the busy city, as is a visit to Al-Azhar Park."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Districts,,"Greater Cairo is vast; with more than 20 million people (2018), it's the largest metropolitan area in Africa and the Middle East."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Districts,,"Downtown The modern city centre. Midan Tahrir (meaning ""Liberation Square"") was the scene of the massive 2011 protests that ousted President Mubarak, and big (sometimes violent) rallies and protests still occur here.

The Downtown area stretches east 2 km to Midan Ramses, which contains Cairo's main railway station and a burgeoning retail and accommodation zone."

But above all it's renowned for the pyramids , at Giza's western edge: this area is known as the Haram (pyramid) district. The Grand Egyptian Museum opens here in 2023."

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Buy,,"ATMs are found in various places throughout downtown . A more secure option are the ATMs in the five star hotels. There also are numerous places that handle currency exchange, or you can try any major bank such as HSBC or Commercial International Bank for currency exchanges or redeeming travellers cheques. There also are a number of Citibank [dead link] branches in Cairo."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Buy,,"Foreign currencies can also be exchanged for Egyptian pound in all the Egyptian banks like Banque Misr , National Bank of Egypt [dead link] , Banque de Caire [dead link] , Arab African Bank [dead link] , the United Bank [dead link] , or the large branches of Bureau de Change."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Buy,,"Many merchants will try to scam you out of as much as they possibly can. A particularly common trick are the papyrus museums. They come in many different flavours, but they often call themselves galleries, museums or workshops. You will be given a brief talk or demonstration on how papyrus is made, and warned against cheaper shops that make their papyrus from banana leaf (though no matter where you go, no one has a sample to show you, questioning the legitimacy of this ""warning""). The prices will be in the hundreds, and you will be offered what appears to be an excellent discount. If you look around, however, you will see most of what they offer is worth LE1-5 at the most. Tour guides, taxi drivers and hotel staff are all in on this, and will often get a 50% commission if they lead an unwitting tourist into this trap."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Buy,,"The Khan El-Khalili bazaar is a giant souq in Islamic Cairo . The merchants here are ravenous and skilled, so don't fall for the hard sell and be prepared to haggle . This is a great place to buy rustic glassware and perfume bottles. Be choosy."

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"Cairo has an enormous number of restaurants, catering to most needs. Ironically though, one may want to avoid any restaurants listed in popular guidebooks. Egyptian restaurants have a habit of after being listed, cooking up a special English menu with vastly inflated prices. That said, cheap food can be found everywhere in street restaurants and snack stalls. The top notch restaurants are often, but not always, found in hotels and Nile boats. The borders between restaurants and cafes are not crystal-clear in the Egyptian capital. In many places it is perfectly acceptable to just have a drink or sheesha . Medium and high-range outlets might have a minimum charge. Cheaper restaurants will normally not serve alcohol as well as some more expensive outlets."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"In general, downtown is good for budget eating, while for higher quality eating you should head to Zamalek , Mohandiseen or any of the other more affluent parts of town."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"Traditional Egyptian staples are available almost everywhere. In stalls and street restaurants you will find traditional dishes like fūl (bean paste), falāfel , moussaka , koshari (rice, macaroni, lentils, chick peas and tomato sauce), feTīr (pancakes with different fillings) and shawarma (an import from Lebanon and Syria — pieces of roasted meat usually wrapped in bread). Cheaper places will only serve up vegetables and maybe beef hot dogs or corned beef. Eggs, fried potatoes and salads are also usually available. Hygiene varies wildly and the best advice is to go for the most visited places. Avoid empty restaurants as the food will be less fresh. Especially downtown, you can find many good koshari shops, including many outlets of the excellent Koshari Tahrir chain. Delicious and cheap fūl, falāfel, and shawarma sandwiches can be bought at the many outlets of popular Gad fast food chain dotted around Cairo. The average price for a tub of takeaway koshari is LE3-5, fūl or falāfel sandwiches is LE1-1.5, and shawarma sandwiches are LE4-8."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"In the medium and upper price range your choice of traditional Egyptian food will be more limited. Although the situation is improving, traditionally Egyptian gastronomical experiences are still mostly restricted to private homes. Quality chain restaurants like Felfela (several outlets), Abou El Sid (Zamalek, Maadi and Dokki), Cairo Kitchen (Zamalek and Maadi), and Abou Shakra offer authentic Egyptian food."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"Otherwise oriental or Middle Eastern restaurants tend to mix styles or completely go for more Lebanese-style eating, considered more stylish by rich Cairenes. The good side of this is that Cairo is blessed with many quality Lebanese outfits, from chains like Dar Al-Qamar to stylish restaurant establishments. Additionally, Turkish food and restaurants catering to Gulf visitors can be found."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"Cairo has a growing number of Western fast food outlets available - these are, incidentally, some of the best places to see young Cairenes relaxing together, as fast food restaurants are apparently considered among the hippest places to hang out.

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"There is also a cute TGI Friday's [dead link] on the Nile banks at the entrance of Maadi, serving beer but no wine. Gezira also has its very own Chili's.

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"For health reasons it is advisable not to drink tap water or eat unpeeled fresh fruits and vegetables—at least for the first few days of the visit. There are few solely vegetarian options, L'aubergine in Zamalek is a good restaurant for vegetarian food. Otherwise, Egyptian cuisine is dominated by vegetable courses, but be aware of ""hidden"" meat in stock, sauces and the like. One should also be cautious about frozen drinks or ice creams sold outside of main hotels. Also, if served eggs, one should be cautious to ensure that they are fully cooked (sunny side up eggs may allow certain organisms to be transmitted)."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"The Metro chain and Alfa Market dotted around Cairo are convenient supermarkets. They often stock Western brands. Otherwise vegetables and fruit are plentiful and cheap.

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"By far the cheapest and most satisfying option, buying from souks and outdoor markets makes for a crash course in Arabic and haggling, not to mention that the produce is often superb! Bread can be found on nearly every corner and comes in two types - whole wheat aysh baladi and white flour aysh shami . Both are baked fresh daily and delivered by thousands of kids on bicycles to every corner of the city. Every neighborhood has a few streets dedicated to produce and other goods. Always wash fruit thoroughly before eating. Eating a fresh Roma tomato in the heat of Summer straight from a market seller after being washed is a delight, hard to match. The fruits and vegetables in Egypt may not conform to EU or US standards of size, but their taste is far superior."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Eat,,"Small bakeries ( furne ) sell every kind of baked good imaginable - ranging from Italian style bread sticks with nigella and sesame seeds to croissants, donuts and anything with dates in it.

At the other end of the scale, almost any street in Cairo has a traditional coffee house, ´ahwa, a traditionally male institution of social life tracing many hundreds of years back in history.

In addition to the traditional Turkish coffee and shai tea, virtually everywhere you'll find drinks like hibiscus tea kerkedeeh , served warm or cold depending on season, sahleb , a milk-based drink usually served in winter, fakhfakhenna (a kind of fruit salad), sugarcane juice, mango and tamarind juice, Tamr hindi ."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,,"Cairo remains one of the best cities in the world to sample the traditional coffee house culture of the region.

While considered ""old fashioned"" for a time, these places are again turning fashionable among younger crowds and even smoking a water-pipe is no longer a male-only pastime.

It is the place to chat, pick up the latest news, read the paper, watch a TV show or a soccer match, or simply people watch while puffing a waterpipe sheesha . Some say there are more than 20,000 coffee houses in Cairo. Today Downtown and Islamic Cairo are the best places to visit for a sampling of this essential part of Cairene life."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,,"For many, the sheesha or water pipe, is the main attraction of any visit to a Cairene coffee house. It is usually available in at least two varieties, mu´assal , pure tobacco, and tofâh , apple-flavored. Other fruit varieties are sometimes available. Coffee houses range from the more elaborately decorated to a simple counter and some plastic chairs and tables spread out in the street. Foreigners are invariably made welcome, although women might feel uncomfortable visiting coffee houses in traditional, poor areas of the city. However, in downtown and the tourist areas of Islamic Cairo single or women-only groups should not expect anything more than the ordinary hassle."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,,"Turkish coffee ( ´ahwe turki ) is served either sweet ( helwa ), medium sweet ( masbout ), with little sugar ( sukr khafeef ) or no sugar ( sâda ). Sweet means very sweet. Tea ( shai ) is served either as traditional loose tea ( kûshari , not to be confused with the Cairo macaroni-rice stample kushari ), known as dust tea in English, or in a tea bag. Most coffee shops usually offer fresh mint leaves to put in your tea, upon request. A range of soft drinks are usually available. Most typically you will find hibiscus tea ( karkadee ), served warm in the winter season and cold during the warmer parts of the year."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,,"During the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed.

Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks."

It is usually available in at least two varieties, mu´assal , pure tobacco, and tofâh , apple-flavored. Other fruit varieties are sometimes available. Coffee houses range from the more elaborately decorated to a simple counter and some plastic chairs and tables spread out in the street. Foreigners are invariably made welcome, although women might feel uncomfortable visiting coffee houses in traditional, poor areas of the city. However, in downtown and the tourist areas of Islamic Cairo single or women-only groups should not expect anything more than the ordinary hassle."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Traditional coffee houses,"Turkish coffee ( ´ahwe turki ) is served either sweet ( helwa ), medium sweet ( masbout ), with little sugar ( sukr khafeef ) or no sugar ( sâda ). Sweet means very sweet. Tea ( shai ) is served either as traditional loose tea ( kûshari , not to be confused with the Cairo macaroni-rice stample kushari ), known as dust tea in English, or in a tea bag. Most coffee shops usually offer fresh mint leaves to put in your tea, upon request. A range of soft drinks are usually available. Most typically you will find hibiscus tea ( karkadee ), served warm in the winter season and cold during the warmer parts of the year."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Traditional coffee houses,"A social institution When coffee was introduced to the Arab and Islamic world in the 1600s the Islamic clergy attempted to outlaw it. However people's cravings soon convinced the sheikhs against this, although even today the most pious followers of Islam would still avoid visiting an ´ahwa. For most Egyptian men however, it is an important social institution, usually near one's home and the local mosque or church. It is the place to chat, pick up the latest news, read the paper, watch a TV show or a soccer match, or simply people watch while puffing a waterpipe sheesha . Some say there are more than 20,000 coffee houses in Cairo. Today Downtown and Islamic Cairo are the best places to visit for a sampling of this essential part of Cairene life."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Fruit juice stalls,"During the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed. Basically these places sell fresh-pressed juice of whatever is in season. Typical choices include orange ( borto ' ân ), lemon ( lamūn ), mango ( manga ) and strawberry ( farawla ), guava ( gawafa ), pomegranate ( Rommân ). Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Fruit juice stalls,"A health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general, food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. Some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Modern cafes and pastry shops,"Modern cafes and patisseries are spread out around the city. Typically they serve light food like sandwiches and salad in addition to espresso-based coffees and pastries. Many of these places are chains, like Cilantro, Beanos, Cinnabon, Orangette, the Bakery and Coffee Roastery. Most of these places, including all the chains mentioned above, offer wireless internet connection as well. International chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks are also widely available throughout Cairo."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Drink,Nightlife,"For the capital of a Muslim country, Cairo is relatively liberal when it comes to the consumption of alcohol. A wide range of bars and dance clubs is available, basically in every major hotel, and some are open 24/7. If you would like to explore the less fancy drinking places in Cairo, Downtown is definitely the place to go. Upscale nightspots are found in and around the Zamalek area"

Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Scams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:"
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"During politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be careful who you go with and under no circumstance let anyone push or guide you anywhere that you do not want to go! If you get lost look for the security and police officers. Many speak some English, and most know their local area very well as well as the tourist spots."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Crossing streets is another major challenge in Cairo. Traffic lights, which only exist in a few locations, are routinely disregarded. In downtown Cairo, police officers may be controlling traffic at key intersections at busy times. Crossing the street is like playing the video game ""Frogger"", hurrying across the street one lane at a time, when there is a small break in traffic. One way to cross a street that proved to be effective is to place yourself next to an Egyptian who wants to cross the street and follow."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Also, when riding in a taxi, the driver may go quite fast and drive erratically. If at any time you feel unsafe, tell the driver to stop and get out."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Be careful about wearing the jerseys of local football clubs Al Ahly and Zamalek, as violent incidents have been known to occur between the supporters of both clubs."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"The place you're going to is closed, why don't you take my tour? (Taxi drivers may use this. You can avoid this by using Uber or Careem.)"
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"You need help crossing the street? Come, let me help you!"
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Let me show you my shop, it's just on this corner. No this corner, no this corner, etc."
Cairo,Egypt,Africa,Stay safe,,"Let me show you how to get to the mosque - no baksheesh, just LE50 to get in and go up to the roof. (Your new friend then tips the mosque guardian LE10 and pockets the rest.)"
