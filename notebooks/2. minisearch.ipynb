For example, entry to Westminster Abbey costs £20 per person (adult), and entry to the Tower is £21.50 per adult if bought online (2017). These prices can be sometimes mitigated by a purchase of London Pass, which needs to be done at the London Pass website . The pass comes in several varieties and gives access to over 60 attractions, including both Westminster Abbey and the Tower. For example, a day pass costs £62 for an adult (2017). The best strategy, if one wants to visit several expensive high-profile attractions, is to buy a day pass and to try visiting all of them in the same day. This requires some advanced planning and will not give you much time at each place you visit - for example, it can take an hour on public transport to travel between the Tower of London and London Zoo.'},\n",

The average cost of hotel accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city. Prices invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football/rugby fixtures), or other important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance.'}]"

      "\n",
      "1. **Best Time to Visit**: The best time to visit Cairo is during the fall (September to November) or spring (March to May) when the weather is pleasant and temperatures are mild.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dress Code**: Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites. Women should cover their shoulders and knees, and both men and women should avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Safety**: Cairo is generally safe, but pickpocketing can occur in crowded areas. Keep your belongings secure and be cautious in tourist areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transportation**: Taxis are widely available and relatively inexpensive. However, it's recommended to use licensed taxis or ride-hailing services like Uber or Careem for safety and convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Must-See Attractions**:\n",
      "   - The Great Pyramids of Giza\n",
      "   - The Egyptian Museum\n",
      "   - The Citadel of Saladin\n",
      "   - Khan el-Khalili Bazaar\n",
      "   - The Hanging Church (Church of St. Sergius)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Food**: Try local Egyptian dishes like koshary, ful medames, and shawarma. Street food is popular and delicious, but be cautious with hygiene.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Language**: Arabic is the official language, but English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Currency**: The Egyptian Pound (EGP) is the official currency. Credit cards are accepted in many places, but it's a good idea to have some cash on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Health**: Stay hydrated, especially during the hotter months. Drink bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Also, be cautious with street food and ensure it's cooked thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Respect Local Culture**: Be respectful of local customs and traditions. Greetings are important, and it's considered rude to show the soles of your feet.\n"
